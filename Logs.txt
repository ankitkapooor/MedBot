hi just google it and it says i have a strange feeling in my chest but i don't think it could be from a chest infection. but it can be caused by a combination of some of the bacteria or something like an infection on the chest that could cause it. but the reason is this is a very common condition in the uk and i know you don't have any health issues and i don't have any problem with it.

hi i do not believe that there is a physical difference between you and me. if the symptoms are similar then that's the only way to know. it's a good idea to see if this has a physical difference. it's not a medical emergency so if you have a physical problem with your chest then you may need to see your doctor. good luck

hi your doctor is saying if i have pain then you should see a doctor. he could tell from your chest what pain you have. the doctor may be trying to explain this to you but this is a normal area and could be a sign of inflammation or some form of inflammation. if you feel that you are in pain i would suggest seeing a specialist who can examine you. do hope this helps. good luck

i don't know what causes it but my doctor said that the pain in my chest is caused by an inflammatory bowel disease. if the pain is caused by an inflammatory bowel disease and the inflammation goes away there could be a possibility of an inflammatory bowel disease. i would suggest you get medical attention now so it's up to you and your doctor to make an appointment with you.

hi you just need to see a doctor and he can do a scan to see if your chest pain has subsided. do not worry if he can see you a few days later. if you are having a problem or you are having symptoms like a sore throat or a lump in your chest you can try a heartburn or something like that just to make sure you are not having any problems. just do not worry. do not overthink if you are having any of these things or are having any of the symptoms. good luck

User: I have a weird pain in my throat
MedBot: i think you should see a neurologist to see if you can have a problem. the first step in diagnosing a specific medical problem is a few simple tests. there is no need for a neurologist to diagnose a specific medical problem. a few things to consider include: 
User: How do I know if I have thyroid?
MedBot: hi you can try this one. its a thyroid hormone but it is a hormone that is produced by your thyroid gland that is called your thyroid gland and is called your thyroid hormone. this is the way in which you get your body's natural hormone hormones that are released through your body to help your body maintain normal function and function. if your thyroid hormone is in the wrong place try to get the thyroid hormone removed to normal and it will not work. the reason for this is because of the thyroid hormone deficiency that can happen due to the thyroid hormone deficiency. the problem with this is that it is difficult for you to get enough thyroid hormone for your body to maintain proper function. so it is best to see your doctor.
