Question: can the colon cause panic attacks and severe anxiety?
Answer: panic attacks are not just an emotional response. if you have ever felt your heart beating very hard it means you have high blood pressure. i know that when i get panic attacks i can't breathe properly and/or i get squeezing headaches. and if you have too much of a food or a certain drink that can also trigger a panic attack. but the best way that i know to stop a panic attack is to either hold your breath for 30 seconds or to just relax yourself and breathe slowly or drink a certain amount of water. best of luck! <|endoftext|> 

Question: i suffer from anxiety and panick attacks best medication (zoloft? ). i have anxiety and panick attacks. i am 20 year old female (130 pounds). i'm really nervous to start taking anxiety meds and have done a lot of research on zoloft. i am just wondering if this medication is good and if will cause long term effects? i also fear that i will be unable to deal with withdrawel symptoms when and if i want to ever get off it and will be worse off then i was before i took it. i don't want to become dependant on these meds. if anyone has any advice please help.
Answer: zoloft works different for a lot of people. when i took it it gave me an insane energy boost and i got my motivation back. but i was also hit with some side effects that weren't going to be ignored and were hard to live with so after a couple months my meds were changed. i didn't have any withdrawal during the transition. just make sure you know most meds can take up to a month to experience the true benefit of the medication and change of dosage is common. <|endoftext|>

Question: what are the risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy?
Answer: reasons that a pregnancy may be considered high risk include: maternal age. one of the most common risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy is the age of the mother-to-be. women who will be under 17 or over 35 when their baby is due are at greater risk of complications than those between their late teens and early 30s. the risk of miscarriage and genetic defects further increases after age 40. medical conditions that exist before pregnancy. conditions such as high blood pressure; breathing kidney or heart problems; diabetes; autoimmune disease; sexually transmitted diseases (stds); or chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can present risks for the mother and/or her unborn baby. a history of miscarriage problems with a previous pregnancy or pregnancies or a family history of genetic disorders are also risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy. if you have a medical condition it's important to consult your doctor before you decide to become pregnant. your doctor may run tests adjust medications or advise you of precautions you need to take to optimize the health of you and your baby. medical conditions that occur during pregnancy. even if you are healthy when you become pregnant it is possible to develop or be diagnosed with problems during pregnancy that can affect you and your baby. two of the more common pregnancy-related problems are: preeclampsia is a syndrome that includes high blood pressure urinary protein and swelling; it can be fatal for the mother and/or baby if not treated. with proper treatment however many women who develop preeclampsia have healthy babies. gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. women with gestational diabetes may have healthy pregnancies and babies if they follow the treatment plan from their health-care provider. usually the diabetes resolves after delivery. however women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. pregnancy-related issues. often a pregnancy is classified as high risk because of issues that arise from the pregnancy itself and that have little to do with the mother's health. these include: premature labor is labor that begins before the 37th week of pregnancy -- the point at which the baby is deemed full-term. although there is no way to know which women will experience preterm labor or birth there are factors that place women at higher risk such as certain infections a shortened cervix or previous preterm birth. multiple births means you are carrying more than one baby (twins triplets quadruplets etc. ). multiple pregnancies which are more common as women are using more infertility treatments increase the risk of premature labor gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix. the condition can cause bleeding especially if a woman has contractions. if the placenta still covers the cervix close to delivery the doctor may schedule a cesarean section to reduce bleeding risks to the mother and baby. fetal problems which can sometimes be seen on ultrasound. approximately 2% to 3% of all babies have a minor or major structural problem in development. sometimes there may be a family history of fetal problems but other times these problems are completely unexpected. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are some pregnancy symptoms?
Answer: once we decide we're ready to be pregnant most of us are ready to be pregnant now. suddenly we're much more aware of our cycles and our bodies. we chart our ovulation carefully we time our bd and then we wait — which is the hardest part. we watch for any symptoms that might indicate pregnancy and with every pang or every woozy feeling we think "is that a symptom? " to talk a little about the science of symptoms… most current pregnancy tests are based on the presence of a chemical called human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). although this chemical is present very early the pregnancy has to connect with your blood system before it can be detected and before you would expect your body to have any symptoms of pregnancy. this connection is made with implantation which occurs 8-10 days after conception. so symptoms (and a positive pregnancy test) might occur a few days before you actually miss your period. breast changes: there can be a dramatic increase in breast volume early in pregnancy resulting in breast tenderness tingling or noticeable increase in size. this symptom can happen days before you miss your period. nausea and vomiting: this symptom tends to happen a little later than the breast changes but definitely in the first trimester. it generally happens around the time of your missed period or slightly later (4-6 weeks pregnant) and resolves around 14-16 weeks of your pregnancy. it has been called morning sickness but actually is present throughout the day. fatigue: it can be dramatic through the first trimester but doesn't usually show up before you've missed your period. pelvic cramping: many women complain of cramping in early pregnancy. they usually describe it as feeling "like my period is about to start. " it can last for weeks but usually remains more of a background nuisance discomfort than real pain. although it is a very common normal symptom you should discuss any pelvic pain in early pregnancy with your physician because it can sometimes be a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition. bleeding: this is a scary one! many normal pregnancies can have light bleeding with implantation. but when you tell us about bleeding we're worried about the same thing you're worried about could this be a miscarriage. fortunately we can usually sort things out fairly quickly and put everyone's mind at ease. although it's a very common "normal" symptom it's another symptom that is sometimes a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition so be sure to tell your physician about any unexpected bleeding. of all of the symptoms listed above breast changes are really the only symptoms that usually occur before you've missed a period. but of course as human beings we have not only the "science" of symptoms to consider but the emotional component as well — after all deciding to get pregnant is an emotional decision. so the tricky part for most women is that we can sometimes experience some of these symptoms — or think we are experiencing the symptoms — but we're not pregnant at all. quite an emotional rollercoaster to ride month after month! **to re-emphasize: the symptoms listed above can be symptoms of pregnancy but they can also be symptoms of other medical conditions — please see your doctor if you experience these symptoms. ** <|endoftext|> 

Question: while on birth control i took an antibiotic and was late taking birth control pills. could i be pregnant if i had sex?
Answer: the risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills (bcps) is very low. in fact antifungals (e. g. ketoconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin azythromycin biaxin) actually increased blood levels of estradiol--not decrease them. being late taking some bcps can also increase [the] risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days. unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills. . i would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test. for the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack. . <|endoftext|>

Question: how can i protect myself against sexually transmitted diseases (stds) during pregnancy?
Answer: here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting stds: consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent stds. use a latex condom every time you have sex particularly if you have more than one sex partner. (if you use a lubricant make sure it is water-based. ) limit your number of sexual partners. the more partners you have the more likely you are to catch a std. practice monogamy. this means having sex with only one person. that person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk. choose your sex partners with care. don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have a std or who has many sexual partners. get checked for stds. don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. just because you've been screened for stds early on in your pregnancy does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. if you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last std screen you need another set of screening tests. also you should be concerned if your partner may be having unprotected sex with other people. don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. you may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. plus alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby. know the signs and symptoms of stds. look for them in yourself and your sex partners. learn about stds. the more you know about stds the better you can protect yourself. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how can i slow my pulse for a few hours? no breathing techniques or meditation please. need to pass a medical screen but my bpm is hitting 102. i know this is due to anxiety. the screening doctor says it's tachycardia but i just get anxious around his loud ekg won't accept anxiety as an answer. my own doctor measures my bpm while monitoring my wrist/neck with a stopwatch. my pulse is always under 85 there. at hone i monitor my own pulse with a home ekg it is also always under 85. is there any otc medication to lower my pulse? any fruits or vegetables?
Answer: my friend i am sorry but there are no vegetables or over the counter medications that can slow down your heart rate. i would suggest telling your screening doctor that you are very anxious and that you suspect it is anxiety because lets be honest. its pretty intimidating. 85 as a resting heart rate is pretty fast but can be normal. for long term solutions i would try running or doing some sort of cardiovascular exercise. this can reduce anxiety and get your heart into shape which will lower your resting heart rate. for short term results. breathing exercises it is. <|endoftext|>

Question: weight loss and anxity. anxiety after health scare. felt a lump in my breast and went though all the testing and everything came back fine. since while waiting for a second opinion (ocd a little) have had an overwhelming sense of anxiety. don't want to eat i do i get a sick stomach lost about 5 lbs in two weeks. trouble sleeping can't seem to enjoy anything. a huge fear something is wrong with me. myissues? appointment is this week and i am just wondering if this is normal anxiety related
Answer: your reaction to finding lump in your breast is completely understandable and normal. i believe that your anxiety is really fear. anxiety and fear are interrelated conditions. anxiety causes fear and fear causes anxiety. but there are differences. anxiety is a common emotion that is usually due to some vague feeling of apprehension without an obvious threat. an example might be walking down a dark street alone at night and feeling afraid. fear on the other hand is an emotional response to a definite threat. for example someone approaches you on that same dark street and says “stick them up”. now you have a real threat and are justifiability fearful. that lump in your breast was a real threat and must be considered as a legitimate fear. once that fear is totally removed your anxious feelings should subside. until you get a clean bill of health from your 2nd opinion physician please attempt to direct your focus on the results of your first opinion. enjoy life enjoy your family and have fun. i hope that your wait to hear positive news this week is swift and that your emotional health is instantly restored. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what's wrong with me? i have symptoms of paranoid maladptive daydreaming anxiety disorder. i think i'm paranoid i have most symptoms of it i also have this maladaptive daydreaming and usually about sad stories where i always cry i oftenly do lucid dreaming i have anxiety disorder i feel shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat always. i don't know if i am traumatized but i never thought of having suicide never. are these just the effect stress? i thought everytime i'm going crazy already. i wanna know what's wrong with me? thank you for answering and i think i also need advices

Question: what's wrong with me? i have symptoms of paranoid maladptive daydreaming anxiety disorder. i think i'm paranoid i have most symptoms of it i also have this maladaptive daydreaming and usually about sad stories where i always cry i oftenly do lucid dreaming i have anxiety disorder i feel shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat always. i don't know if i am traumatized but i never thought of having suicide never. are these just the effect stress? i thought everytime i'm going crazy already. i wanna know what's wrong with me? thank you for answering and i think i also need advices
Answer: one of your questions is " are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress? " i don't think that they are just stress related. you are also not "crazy" as suggested in your post. schizophrenic individuals for example feel that their hallucinations are real while you definitely live in a state of reality in being aware that you are daydreaming. maladaptive daydreaming (preoccupation with daydreaming where large blocks of daily time are spent fantasying) ) is not well understood by many medical professionals. its cause is unknown. some of your symptoms like feeling paranoid intense and complex daydreaming (can be so realistic that it’s as though you're reading a novel) and feeling anxious can all be related to the one disorder maladaptive daydreaming. here's what you can do: look for triggers that may set of the daydreaming episodes. some activities like playing video games may activate the daydreaming and oftentimes associated fantasies; be good to yourself and realize that you'll have good and bad days with mdd. look for positive ways to plan and spend your time and divert your actions away from daydreaming; find a physician that thoroughly understands maladaptive daydreaming and follow their treatment directions. with talk therapy and medications you can decrease these unwanted chucks of wasted time being taken away from what should be a productive day. i am optimistic about your future. <|endoftext|> 

Question: currently taking 75mg of paxil for anxiety. noticing it is not working as well as before. what should i add to it? . i have been on 75mg of paxil cr for three years for treating my panic attacks and general anxiety. it has worked very well. about three weeks ago i started noticing some anxiety creeping back in and i know i'm maxed out on the paxil. should i ask my doctor about adding something like abilify or some other drug to help boost me back to where i was? or should i seek a different ssri altogether? i'm nervous about the latter simply because the paxil has worked so well for so long. thanks!
Answer: you are correct in suspecting that the paxil is no longer working at controlling your conditions. many of the ssri's including zoloft and prozac have the same quality of no longer working after a period of therapeutic symptom improvement. after several years of reliable benefit these ssri's may even begin to heighten the anxiety symptoms. i would not recommend taking abilify. it has been shown to have many serious side-effects including affecting blood sugar results. while i understand that you do not want to give-up on a drug that once was effective it is probably best to try another medicine. <|endoftext|>

Question: can stress and anxiety cause ibs. recently had colonscopy and endoscopy everything fine. . stomach always feeling funny
Answer: the exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) isn't known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors. it's important to note ibs is a long-term disorder. it is not something that "comes and goes. " usually a person who has symptoms of ibs has them regularly for many years. on the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too. this is not ibs per se because the episodes go away. stress and anxiety can cause: stomach upset nausea diarrhea among other things. it's also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose ibs. these tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like crohn's disease. so the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were "fine" does not mean you don't have ibs. you should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is -- if you have a diagnosis at all. wishing you well! <|endoftext|>

Question: can stress and anxiety cause vertigo. i took a test and my stress level was diagnosed as 74 percent when i get stressed or anxious i tent to dig in my ears i have been diagnosed with anxiety severe panic disorder and agoraphobia of which i am alone 10 to 12 hours a day 4 to 5 days a week. and lately i have been under an enormous amount of stress the last 3 to 4 weeks financial worries having enough food the anniversary of my moms death and last night i was forced to drive last night can all this cause vertigo?
Answer: one of the hardest parts about controlling anxiety is that severe anxiety can actually cause physical symptoms that lead to more anxiety. many of those with anxiety start to worry about their health because the symptoms can be so disabling that it's hard to convince your mind that anxiety could be causing them. this is often the case with vertigo. vertigo itself is not technically an anxiety symptom but dizziness – which is often confused with the idea of vertigo – very much is and it's actually a surprisingly common one. since vertigo is almost exclusively caused by hyperventilation the best way to stop the feeling of having vertigo is to make sure that you're not hyperventilating anymore. often this is easier said than done. in the middle of an anxiety attack it's very hard to re-gain control of your breathing. but there are tricks that make the process easier now the trick here is a nice brown paper bag this you put over you head and re-breath your output works all the time. do hope this helps you. good luck ps try getting your life together that would help cut down your problems. <|endoftext|>

Question: for the past few days i have been experiencing dizziness and slight pressure in my head is it anxiety related? . i was taking birth control but was having side effects so i stopped a few days ago. my symptoms tend to come and go a lot of the times i notice them when i am at work. when i am home relaxing the symptoms seem to go away. i do worry a lot and wonder if this could be anxiety related (i have been having tests done for possibly a risk of cervical cancer) or possibly still having side effects to my birth control.
Answer: this could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people. since your symptoms seem to improve when you're not at work and you've only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests i would suspect that anxiety could be the cause. it could also ironically be a side-effect from stopping (or starting) the birth control which can have physical side effects. you can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but i don't think you have too much to worry about. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i sometimes feel breathless when sleeping on my side but i don't know if it's a health problem or just stress. over the past few weeks i've felt out-of-breath when falling asleep while lying on my right side. i wake up almost in a panic with my heart racing but i feel better when i sit up for a while and eventually can sleep like normal. this doesn't happen every night though and doesn't happen if i nap during the day. it also only started after i had a health scare (unrelated) while lying in bed which left me afraid to fall asleep. is this a real issue or just anxiety about what happened before?
Answer: you are asking a question that could not be answered over the internet. we do not know anything about you your medical history. but more importantly we have no way of examining you and/or ordering any diagnostic tests. before attributing any medical condition to stress or anxiety a medical provider must first rule out all organic causes that could be attributed to your array of symptoms. i would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can i go on disability if i have been diagnosed with major depression fibromyalgia thalassemia ibs chronic fatigue? . i have already ben out on a 3 month leave of abscence because of my depression and anxiety. i feel it getting worse even with all the meds i am on. i do see both a psychiatrist and therapist. i just feel since i have been back to work now for the past two months things are getting worse.
Answer: it is possible to receive social security disability (ssdi) or supplemental security benefits (ssi) based upon your medical and emotional conditions. do not listen to those well-meaning people who may say that your diagnoses will not qualify you for disability. you do not have to have a terminal disease to become eligible for disability. the waiting process for approval can range from 6 months to several years so you must be ready to live without a regular pay check for some time. you must also be incapable of doing any gainful work. if you feel that you cannot continue to work it is recommended to start the application process immediately. if approved your original application date will be used to establish the approval date and possible retroactive benefits. you may also think about contacting an attorney specializing in helping folks to obtain disability benefits. the application process can be cumbersome and becomes a living legal document which will be used to assess your eligibility. attempting to correct mistakes or supply missing documentation later is not recommended. treat the application responsibility and do it right the first time. if it seems like too much work then it is best to forget applying. the application should be initiated as correctly and completely as possible the first time. you should begin to start a daily diary detailing your activities of daily living and your medical and emotional symptoms experienced. you should also gather all of your medical records from each medical professional that has provided you with medical care. attempt to secure the backing of your primary care doctor as well as other medical specialists to support your disability claim. they may be able to provide you with a letter attesting to your being completely disabled. also seek a letter from your employer stating their observance of you being unable to complete your job responsibilities due to your disabilities. letters from other people testifying that they are aware of your physical and emotional decline may also be useful. the majority of people are denied at the first step of the approval process. but with a legitimate disability being adequately documented and by following the above guidelines eventual disability approval is possible with your clinical conditions. <|endoftext|> 

Question: should i go back to therapy? . i have previously been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and here lately i have been more anxious and depressed mood irritable and just feeling in the dumps my mind is constantly running 24/7 some days i feel like i just need more sleep and others i can run off very little sleep. i am not presently medicated.
Answer: it surely must be a great challenge to endure 24/7 symptoms of anxiety and depression. the positive parts that i gleam from your question are that you already have a diagnosis and also possess some insight into your mood disorders. so at least you’re not starting from point zero. yes you should be assessed and reenter treatment. it is not unusual for your conditions to go into a state of remission and suddenly erupt with an invigorated vengeance. some individuals actually go through cyclical periods of depression and anxiety (like during the fall season when there is less light). they automatically seek treatment during certain times of the year even before overt symptoms appear. it is also common for people who suffer from depression to have anxiety attacks fueled by depression and folks who suffer from bouts of anxiety to also be clinically depressed. these two emotional states work in harmony to reap havoc in the lives of those afflicted. you deserve to feel well and have a joyful life. with talk therapy and medications you can be relieved of this tormenting disorder. by seeking treatment as soon as possible your recovery should be swift and your prognosis promising. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is xanax safe to take for anxiety while on methadone

Question: are food cravings normal during pregnancy?
Answer: food cravings during pregnancy are normal. although there is no widely accepted explanation for food cravings almost two-thirds of all pregnant women have them. if you develop a sudden urge for a certain food go ahead and indulge your craving if it provides energy or an essential nutrient. but if your craving persists and prevents you from getting other essential nutrients in your diet try to create more of a balance in your daily diet during pregnancy. during pregnancy your taste for certain foods may change. you may suddenly dislike foods you were fond of before you became pregnant. in addition during pregnancy some women feel strong urges to eat non-food items such as ice laundry starch dirt clay chalk ashes or paint chips. this is called pica and it may be associated with an iron deficiency such as anemia. do not give in to these non-food cravings -- they can be harmful to both you and your baby. tell your health care provider if you have these non-food cravings. if you have any problems that prevent you from eating balanced meals and gaining weight properly ask you health care provider for advice. registered dietitians -- the nutrition experts -- are available to help you maintain good nutrition throughout your pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Question: social anxiety. i want friends where do i go? i have such bad social anxiety when i first get to know someone but then it lessens
Answer: individuals afflicted with social anxiety tend to worry about being judged by others (especially peers). there may be feelings of being rejected coupled with a lack of self-esteem. as a young child this trait is probably rooted in our genetics and protective in nature. it is part of the normal growth and development process. children in this stage may be referred to as being shy. most young children and adolescents outgrow this condition as they enter into adulthood. where you go to meet friends is wide open. depending on your age some places to meet friends may include: school clubs sporting activities the work place and church to name a few. volunteering to help others is a great way to meet new people while contributing to the community. think about joining a speech club. many members of these clubs start out feeling nervous about engaging in public speaking activities and possibly to speaking in smaller social settings. these club members are usually very supportive and enjoy helping newer participants overcome their speaking fears by developing overall self-confidence. take a personal inventory to determine outside- of -the- house activities that you enjoy and look for an opportunity to participate. many local newspapers dedicate column space to advertising upcoming neighborhood events and meetings. yes some individuals with social anxiety tendencies may best respond to talk therapy and/or medication. but overcoming social anxiety disorder is a process that involves having a small number of interpersonal interactions triumphs and building on their success. practice looking people in the eye and greeting them warmly. say good morning to neighbors colleagues at school and work and even to people at the grocery store while waiting in line. the risks are worth the rewards. these positive experiences tend to promote a sense of confidence. from that added confidence we tend to develop more competence in our social exchanges. the pay-off of your risk taking is that a nice positive circle of social interactions should occur. your self-image and self-esteem will improve resulting in a more enriched life. <|endoftext|>

Question: what do i need to know about my egg supply when considering pregnancy?
Answer: understanding your egg supply both origins and ways in which egg number declines can help you to decide your next steps on the pathway to parenthood. women have their lifetime supply of eggs when they are babies inside their mother. eggs are a time-limited and time-released supply: time-limited because all women will someday go through menopause and time-released because each month only a small group of eggs gain the ability to compete to ovulate. as egg number declines with aging the group of eggs competing to ovulate each month gets smaller. with a smaller group of eggs competing each month women tend to ovulate sooner and have fewer days between periods. eventually there are periods of time where an egg is not available and women will start skipping periods. eventually there is not an egg available to ovulate and a woman will no longer have periods. fertility testing includes tests for egg number and egg release. test of egg number include fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) and amh (antimullerian hormone). fsh is the hormone that pushes eggs to move toward ovulation. when egg supply is low fsh goes up. fsh is high in menopause. amh is made by eggs at an earlier stage in their journey toward ovulation. amh is higher in women with more eggs and lower in women with fewer eggs. amh is undetectable in menopause. tests of egg release include progesterone. progesterone is a hormone that is made by the ovary after ovulation. if a woman has an elevated progesterone one week before her period she is ovulating. if she does not she needs to see her doctor to find out why she is not ovulating. the group of eggs that have the ability to ovulate will only compete if they receive the correct signals. a physician will test hormone levels and make the necessary adjustments to induce ovulation. egg number tests like amh and fsh predict how well you will respond to fertility drugs because they reflect the number of eggs competing to ovulate. if fsh is high and amh is low a woman does not have many "extra eggs" to respond to medication. if she has regular menstrual cycles with a progesterone proving ovulation she is getting at least one egg out. if we try fertility medications and still get only one egg fertility drugs are not helping to improve chances of pregnancy. as long as she continues to ovulate she has a chance for pregnancy. if she wants to improve her chances after fertility drugs with her own eggs are not helping to increase the number of eggs released she can consider using donated eggs. one percent of women will go through premature ovarian failure (before age 40). a reproductive endocrinologist will test to see why egg number declined early and test to see if other glands (thyroid parathyroid pancreas adrenal) are showing signs of low hormone production. women with pof have a 5-10% lifetime chance of pregnancy if an egg remaining in the ovary gains the ability to ovulate ovulates and meets with sperm. currently there is no way to know when or if this post-ovarian failure ovulation will occur. hearing that egg number is low can be devastating. a second opinion can help increase comfort with the diagnosis. a reproductive psychologist can help to discuss the feelings that arise. egg donation embryo donation and adoption can help women with ovarian failure to build their family. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can panic attacks cause hallucinations? . i'm a 15 year old girl and i've always had anxiety but never any panic attacks. last night however i was sitting alone in my sunroom when a large shadow seemed to begin growing before my eyes. it kept growing and i got so terrified. i have never been that scared before. it was true fear in the pit of my stomach. my body was trembling and i could barely move. my heart was racing and i was sweating. i eventually calmed myself by singing. once i was calm i felt very very tired. what was this?
Answer: severe psychological events can potentially cause hallucinations but i think it's rather uncommon for a panic attack to do so. it would not be impossible however for you to have the panic attack first and the hallucination to begin afterwards. it's possible that you simply noticed the visual disturbance before the physical sensation of being afraid and that coming down from the panic left you physically or emotionally tired. i would recommend that you tell someone if this happens again since a lot of other things can cause hallucinations. it's possible that this was an isolated incident but it never hurts to be sure <positive_smiley> <|endoftext|>

Question: can anxiety attack be confused with heart attack?
Answer: yes they can. in fact people experiencing their first anxiety attack often believe they're having a heart attack. symptoms of the two conditions are very similar. if you've never had an anxiety or panic attack before and therefore have not experienced the symptoms you should always err on the side of caution and seek emergency medical attention. granted a heart attack in a younger person would be quite rare but as the old adage goes: better safe than sorry. once you've had a panic attack you can recognize the symptoms of it when it occurs. however no one should attempt to self-diagnose a heart attack versus a panic attack. if you're not sure always call for emergency responders. keep in mind the symptoms of a heart attack can go away on their own. if you've experienced symptoms you believed were a heart attack but then cleared up do not assume you had a panic attack instead. you need to get checked out by a health care professional. wishing you well! <|endoftext|>

Question: what causes back pain in pregnant women?
Answer: there are many possible reasons pregnant women may experience back or spinal pain. here are some of the more likely causes: weight gain. during a healthy pregnancy women typically gain between 25 and 35 pounds. this added weight must be supported by the spine which can result in discomfort in your lower back. further the weight of the growing baby and uterus puts pressure on the blood vessels and nerves in the pelvis and back. changes in posture. as your uterus becomes heavier your center of gravity changes. you may gradually -- perhaps without noticing -- begin to adjust your posture and the way you move. this may result in back pain or strain. hormone changes. during pregnancy your body produces a hormone called relaxin that allows ligaments in the pelvic area to relax and the joints to become looser in preparation for the birth process. the same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to loosen leading to instability and pain. muscle separation. as the uterus expands two parallel sheets of muscles (the rectal abdominis muscles) which run from the rib cage to the pubic bone may separate along the center seam. this separation may worsen back pain. stress. emotional stress can cause muscle tension in the back which may be felt as back pain or back spasms. you may find that you experience an increase in back pain during stressful periods of your pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Question: i am 37 and trying to get pregnant for a year and a half. will clomid be effective if i have been ovulating normally? . we have a 4 year old daughter and had no problems conceiving her. both my husband and i were tested and our results were within normal limits.
Answer: in many cases unexplained infertility is associated with an age-related decline in fertility. unlike sperm that are being made continuously eggs are all made before a woman is born. as a woman ages her eggs age which results in embryos that make mistakes in cell division more often. this causes more unrecognized miscarriages (infertility) recognized miscarriages and down's syndrome as women age. the average age that women show up complaining of unexplained infertility is around 34-36 years old. for this reason a common theme in counteracting the age-related decline in fertility is increasing the number of eggs that a woman recruits each month. clomid is a drug that corrects some ovulation problems and it also occasionally increases the number of eggs that a woman recruits. it is a fairly safe and inexpensive first step. however many women will eventually need to use gonadotropins (fsh) to increase the number of eggs. this is call controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and can be followed by intercourse insemination or oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer. the differences between these therapies is the probability of success each month the risk of multiple gestation or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and the cost of the therapy. your doctor can help you navigate these options. <|endoftext|>

Answer: diverticulitis is thought to be caused by a lack of fiber in the diet. as we get older pressure on the intestine walls increases causing pain cramping constipation and bloating. there is no mention by the medical community that depression stress or anxiety contributes to the development of diverticulitis. with that said i have my own opinion on the subject. that is: the body is a wonderful machine that best operates when all organs are working at peak efficiency and in a synergistic manner. being anxious depressed and full of stress are emotional conditions that negatively influence our overall health including the development of diverticulitis symptoms. here are some suggestions to consider: obtain a diverticulitis diet from your doctor reduce stress in your life drink at least 64 ounces of water daily talk with a trained professional to evaluate your depression. perhaps you may require medication to kick-start your mood out the depressive state. exercise as much as you can. i believe that our psychological well-being affects our overall physical well-being. <|endoftext|>

Question: i don't feel "right". is this general anxiety? . i overanalyze everything. if i say something wrong or do something that didn't even feel wrong in the moment i'll be reliving it for hours or days. and it's not just the things that happened today or a few days ago. it's stuff that happened years ago too. i feel like i'm getting worked up over nothing but i can't make it go away. i've had a phobia since i was little and i had my first major panic attack when i was 13. can those lead to general anxiety? could i have general anxiety?
Answer: luckylucas first have you had any traumatic experiences in the past few years? you describe reliving these exeriences for days and in one case you mention this has been going on for years. do you suffer from hypervigilence (always looking over your shoulder) to see if anything frightening is there. do you see on tv in public hear conversations or noises that remind you of a traumatic event. do you have startled responses to certain stimuli that remind you of traumatic issues. is your sleep good or bad. do you anger easily or isolate yourself? if so you may want to see a psychologist or psychiatrist and have an evaluation for ptsd. disorders like phobias panic attacks depression and obsessive compulsive behaviors are very much a part of the ptsd syndrome. the key to your question is "i cant make it go away" which is a classic example of ptsd. these are called intrusive thoughts; you cannot get rid of. ordinarily treatment for gad panic attack and ocd are very treatable with therapy and medication. however ptsd is one of only two memory based disorders in dsm-5. the other is dementia or alzheimer's disease. basically what i am saying is you cannot erase a memory is why ptsd is usually a life long disorder with no cure. the best treatment is a combination of medications and management of your symptoms. i hope this helps. patrick4287 licensed psychologist <|endoftext|>

Question: i need help with my anxiety. i have borderline personality disorder. i recently moved out on my own; i am miserable. my anxiety is the worst it has ever been. i can feel myself getting more depressed. i am already on zoloft but that doesnt help at all anymore. i am so edgy and it hurting my relationships with everyone around me. please help! i don't know how much longer i can stand all of this. i want to be a successful adult and be able to take care of myself but everyday it doesnt seem like i am ever going to be able to
Answer: firstly congrats on being independent and living on your own. its a big step but a great one. and at times yes you may feel down or irritated but this can all be helped! your anxiety can also be controlled and personally i think you should be doing this through eating the right foods including lots of raw fruit and vegetables dairy free milk such as oat milk soy milk almond milk or if you do not like that at least low or no fat milk. cut out on all processed foods that contain presertitives flavours or flavor enhancers artificial colors added sugar and high salts. this all has effects on the body and is un-natural. just changing what you eat will help your thought processes. decent exercise is also a great way to relieve anxiety and depression. doing good will make you feel good! and lots of good un-interupted sleep is very important too. at least 8-10 hours. i dont think the zoloft is doing you any good. these are synthetic chemicals that do more damage to your head and body in the long run. join a yoga class or do some volunteer work. getting out and meeting people will make you feel good. try to learn something new everyday and keep your mind active. don't let bad thoughts get in the way of enjoying this precious life you have. hope this helps you in some way <positive_smiley> keep positive! <|endoftext|> 

Question: i am a generally healthy 27 year old who has had multiple normal ecg's. am i fine? . i suffer anxiety attacks and am a hyperchondriac. during the height if panic attacks i have gone into hospital for ecg. all have come back fine and normal. i also was able to organise a chest xray and blood tests. all normal. should i feel assured that my heart is fine and stop worrying about it or is there other tests i should really do to be sure?
Answer: i certainly do not know enough about you or your case to pronounce you "well" and free of all cardiac disease. if you are worried about the status of your heart see a cardiologist and have an ecg taken on a treadmill. if the cardiologist pronounces you heart-healthy then you can be assured that all is well. <|endoftext|>

Question: can your arteries go from normal to clogged in 7 months? i was told i was fine and now i'm scared it has changed. i went to the cardiologist about seven months ago. i had 2 ekgs and an electrocardiogram. everything was normal. i had a very emotionally stressful week and the entire week i've had anxiety issues. during the anxiety i had slight chest pain on my left side. i woke up one morning and i my pectoral muscles were tight and felt like i had a strong workout without working out. during the next 6 days i've had pain and tingling in my arm/under my armpit. is this just a reaction on my anxiety
Answer: hi i m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety i can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and i felt short of breath. to answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in 7 months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods (high in salt and fat). i would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure. <|endoftext|>

Question: i'm pregnant and don't want to bother my health care provider with "false alarms " but when should i call?
Answer: your health care provider is available any time to answer your questions and to ease your concerns about whether or not your contractions are signs of true or false labor. don't be afraid to call your provider if you are not sure what it is you are feeling. he or she may ask you some questions to help determine if you are truly in labor. if there's any question at all it's better to be evaluated by your health care provider. it is essential to call your health care provider at any time if you have: any vaginal bleeding. continuous leaking of fluid or wetness or if your water breaks (can be felt as a "gushing" of fluid). strong contractions every 5 minutes for an hour. contractions that you are unable to "walk through. " a noticeable change in your baby's movement or if you feel less than 10 movements every two hours. any symptoms of contractions if you are not yet 37 weeks. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is a vegan diet safe during pregnancy?
Answer: the warnings are a bit more urgent for pregnant and lactating women who are vegan. having a vitamin b12 deficiency particularly has been shown to impair neurological development in infants nursed by vegetarian mothers. a lack of vitamin d and calcium also can result in bone demineralization in breastfeeding women. similarly young children (under 5) reared on vegetarian and vegan diets can suffer impaired growth. that's because of a vitamin b12 deficiency which can also result in anemia and rickets. yet a well planned diet can meet all the nutritional needs. absorbable calcium is critical too for vegans and ovo-vegetarians to protect against weak bones that can lead to osteoporosis. <|endoftext|> 

Question: if prenatal vitamins are extra good for you when you’re pregnant why not take them all the time?
Answer: these specially formulated multivitamins are designed to ensure pregnant women get all the extra vitamins and minerals essential for the development of a healthy baby and to meet the increased nutritional needs of mom too. they also benefit women who are trying to become pregnant and new mothers who are breastfeeding. specifically prenatal vitamins deliver a bigger boost of folic acid (between 800 and 1 000 micrograms a day much more than the 400 micrograms a day needed by women of childbearing age) to help prevent neural tube defects and increased iron which helps ward off anemia. they also contain amounts of other vitamins and minerals—including niacin riboflavin thiamin and vitamin c—that may be dangerous. for example vitamins a and d can be harmful when taken in too-large quantities. the rest of us should focus on getting all our nutrients from a rich and varied diet. if you want to fill the nutritional gaps in your diet take a once-daily multivitamin formulated for your age group. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can ra medications like implanon affect my ability to get pregnant?
Answer: the real question since you have removed the implanon is whether you are getting your menstrual cycle. if not you are not ovulating at this point in time. it may take you longer. rheumatoid arthritis itself should not affect one's ability to conceive however you did not mention the medication you are currently taking. most medications for ra don't cause problems unless you require chemotherapeutic agents. if you are concerned i would recommend you contact your physician to discuss further. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what happens to your bones during pregnancy and breastfeeding?
Answer: during pregnancy it's important for a woman to get enough calcium for herself as well as her growing baby. most studies show that while some bone loss may occur during pregnancy a woman usually regains it after giving birth. in fact studies show that having children even as many as 10 does not increase a woman's chance of getting osteoporosis later in life. for women who have pregnancies in their teens the effects on bone health later in life are still not certain. teens have not yet reached peak bone mass. more studies are needed to learn if teen pregnancies can affect future bone health. some women develop a temporary type of osteoporosis during pregnancy. while we do not fully understand what causes this type of osteoporosis it is extremely rare and usually goes away shortly after a woman gives birth. breastfeeding for the recommended 6-12 months has many health benefits for mother and baby. like pregnancy breastfeeding may cause some temporary bone loss. however bone density appears to recover over time and should not cause long-term harm to a woman's bone health. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how long should i wait after my pregnancy before having cosmetic surgery?
Answer: i think it is reasonable to wait at least six weeks and only with the consent of the patient’s obstetrician. there are changes that the body undergoes after pregnancy as it kind of “shrinks down” if you will and returns to normal pre-pregnancy physiology. typically that is going to take place in the first several weeks and just to make sure we suggest a six-week interval between the delivery and the cosmetic procedure. it is never wrong to wait a bit longer because the patient might not quite feel up to it and has other new responsibilities as a parent. as indicated above a physical examination must be done including blood counts and all the necessary laboratory tests to know that at that point the patient’s body is functioning just as it would had the patient never been pregnant. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can you get pregnant while on the pill?
Answer: yes you can still get pregnant if you take oral contraception. while birth control pills are an effective method for preventing pregnancy it's very dependent on routine use. if taken exactly as directed the failure rates are extremely low and they're 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. in reality women need to take the pill daily and at nearly the same time of day in order for this method to result in these percentages. more and more studies have shown higher pregnancy rates with oral contraception. one recent study quoted numbers as high as '20 times greater risk of unplanned pregnancy than other forms of birth control' <|endoftext|>

Question: is it safe to have cosmetic surgery when you are pregnant?
Answer: the question of whether or not it is wise to have cosmetic surgery while pregnant comes up most often when a patient who is scheduled for surgery finds out that she is pregnant. she then calls us and asks for our advice. nearly all the procedures that we do in elective cosmetic facial surgery are done under anesthesia; it is never wise to have a procedure while pregnant. that is why we do a pregnancy test just prior to the surgery. the chances of aborting the fetus are extremely high if one has a general anesthetic in the first three months of pregnancy. in any event even if one were beyond the first three months it just doesn’t make much sense because the body during pregnancy has changed with respect to circulating levels of hormones. there are blood count issues and a variety of reasons why it makes absolutely no sense to have an elective procedure during pregnancy. even if an operation could be done under local anesthesia i would never undertake such an operation because the local anesthetic itself gets into the blood stream and could possibly enter the fetal circulation. bottom line why ever take a chance? <|endoftext|> 

Question: are fillers and botox safe to use during pregnancy?
Answer: injectable filling material such as juvéderm restylane radiance and artefill typically do not enter the circulation and therefore it would not appear to be dangerous during pregnancy. understand that the fillers and the wrinkle-softeners botox and dysport are all degraded or metabolized by the body and their end products would not be expected to be injurious any more than any other medication that the mother may be taking. however i am just against any non-essential service being rendered to a patient during pregnancy. in medicine we don’t have 100% certainty as to all the interactions between drugs and the body. so why take the chance? <|endoftext|> 

Question: am i a high-risk pregnancy because i have hashimoto's disease?
Answer: hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. patients will go through a hyperthyroid period euthyroid period and then eventually a hypothyriod period. many patients with this process will have antibodies that will place the patient at a higher risk of postpartum depression. if you are hypothyroid then you need to make sure you are taking enough replacement to make your levels normal. in this way you baby will not be at risk. otherwise your pregnancy should go fairly smoothly. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how long should i wait to get pregnant after chemotherapy?
Answer: pregnancies after chemotherapy are not uncommon but need to be planned after you complete treatment. it's generally recommended a woman wait at least two years to get pregnant after chemotherapy. consult your doctor about your plans to get pregnant. in many cases pregnancy will not influence the return of cancer. but there are situations in which pregnancy should be considered with caution. if infertility is an issue after your treatment is complete there are alternative therapies. discuss your options with your gynecologic doctor. <|endoftext|>

Question: if i'm 2 1/2 weeks pregnant is it safe to ride roller coasters and water rides at a theme park?
Answer: the official response is no you should not go. you will also note many different signs on rides that will say "if you are pregnant you should not go on this ride". the safest thing to do is not go on them. if however you are adventuresome then you may want to give it a try. i doubt you will be harmed this early in pregnancy. i think the real issue is how much do you want this pregnancy. if this is planned and a very desired pregnancy then don't do it. otherwise you need to figure it out. your doctor will tell you not to do it. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can excessive drinking affect ones ability to trust someone? causing anxiety and jumping to conclusions? . i recently was confronted by a friend who goes out a lot and drinks a lot. he asked me if i thought drinking was a cause for him to make rash decisions and be the cause of his inability to trust his girlfriend who lives a few hours and jump to conclusions for no given reason with no reason from her to not trust. anyone have opinions or even medical research on this topic?

Question: should people get "regular" ct scans (or some other head scan) to check for tumors in the brain (before its too late). i just feel that diagnosing/finding tumors early in the process of formation is the best way to prevent serious damage and i understand that tumor growth would exhibit certain symptoms but it is possible that people under high stress/anxiety may think its just because of their lifestyle when in fact there may be a more serious underlying issue. also tumor growth in brain regions that control personality (ie. how outgoing you are being socially awkward etc) may be harder to call a symptom
Answer: the amount of radiation involved in a ct scan would not justify the use as a screening test for the general population. it would probably cause more cancer than it would find. there are very specific symptoms and signs that would indicate an intracranial problem so it would be best to screen these patients first with a neurological exam rather than just recommending that all people get a brain ct scan. just like a pap smear or mammogram. <|endoftext|>

Answer: number one your doctor prescribed u. 25 mg of xanex not 25-mg. 25 mg would kill just about anyone. also idk where u get off saying that it will be out of your system in 6-8 hours when the half life of xanex is 11 hours meaning only half the pill is left in your system after 11 hours. so if you took a bar which is 2-mg than in 11 hours u would have 1-mg in your system so you would have even more than that after only 6-8 hours. the half life keeps getting divided in half after 11 hours but i know drug tests test for the levels of nanograms left in your system which i am pretty sure 1000 nanograms equal 1-mg so do the math yourself if you are that worried and see how many nanograms you need for a minimum to fail which is a lot more than the 1mg. in my example. my example is only for someome taking a 1 single 1mg pill for 1 day. if you took lage amounts multiple days or months because and built it up in your system. please people dont belive all this bs they actually have drug calculators online to input how many drugs u have taken and how long will it take to get out of your sytem by asking questions of your weight and health and it gives you a good round about estimate on how fast your halflife for that type of pill and gives. you a lot more acvurate than i saw one person say 8 hours and some people saying 6-8 weeks. it really all depending on your health (being overweight) and than how fast ur motabalism is. and obviously on high of a dose and how long he has been them because by taking high doses and for a lomg period of time will build the meds up in your system making it take that much longer to get it out. its not just the last pill you have to worry about it is how much you have build up on your body. <|endoftext|>

Question: can douching hurt my chances of having a healthy pregnancy?
Answer: douching may affect your chances of having a healthy pregnancy. limited research shows that douching may make it harder for you to get pregnant. in women trying to get pregnant those who douched more than once a week took the longest to get pregnant. studies also show that douching may increase a woman's chance of damaged fallopian tubes and ectopic (ek-top-ik) pregnancy. ectopic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg attaches to the inside of the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. if left untreated ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening. it can also make it hard for a woman to get pregnant in the future. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what's common range of dosage for zoloft? i have ocd anxiety and some depression.
Answer: dosage of zoloft is individually determined by your medical provider based on your medical history response to previous treatments level of symptoms etc. there are not "common ranges" just the proper dosage that is determined by your medical provider and even this dosage must be titrated or adjusted based on your clinical response. i am not sure of the reason you are asking this question but the pharmacological management of ocd anxiety and depression is not something you should be doing on your own. <|endoftext|>

Question: my cousin is pregnant and has a uti. her doctor put her on an antibiotic for the rest of her pregnancy. is this safe?

Question: my husband and i have been trying to get pregnant for about a year now. what can we do to increase his sperm count?
Answer: trying for one year does suggest it is time to look for possible explanations. sometimes it can take a year or more to get pregnant. first of all until he has had 2 or 3 formal semen analyses by trained lab techs there is no way to know if he is the source of the problem or not. possible sources for infertility from a female include blockage of the fallopian tubes (no signs or symptoms) endometriosis (usually heavy painful periods) hormone irregularities older women (harder to get pregnant) to name a few. from the male side sometimes past events can hurt sperm production like radiation or chemo for cancer hormones for body building etc. the good news is that sperm producing cells are very resilient and can produce sperm once they recover over time. it does take 74 to 90 days to make a sperm. things to improve sperm include avoiding heat down there- heat is bad for sperm so no hot tubs hot saunas or jacuzzis. underwear does not make a difference. he should eat a healthy anti-oxidant rich diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables stay hydrated no tobacco of any kind minimal alcohol no marijuana or other drugs and ejaculate once every 24 to 48 hours. you should remain flat on your back for an hour after sex. you should have the sperm checks done with 3 days of no ejaculation. . <|endoftext|>

Question: i am five and a half months pregnant and take xanax. can this drug harm the fetus and how do i taper off my dosage?
Answer: the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) assigns a category system to classify the possible risks to a fetus when a specific medicine is taken during pregnancy. xanax and its generic (alprazolam) have been assigned pregnancy category d meaning this class of medication have shown clear evidence of risk to the fetus in studies. pregnancy category d is a stronger warning class than pregnancy categories c or b classifications. a pregnancy category d medicine may still be given to a pregnant woman if the health care provider believes that the benefits to the woman outweigh the possible risks to the unborn child. i would not just stop taking the medication if you are concerned that you may be causing harm to your baby. work with your health care provider to decide whether you should be taking the medication. if you reach a decision to not take the medication any longer work with your provider or pharmacist to taper (decrease gradually) the dose to take and to prevent withdrawal symptoms. common withdrawal symptoms consist of but are not limited to nausea vomiting diarrhea increased heart rate palpitations hallucinations memory loss confusion panic attacks seizures dizziness headaches depression and insomnia. it is important to work with your health care provider to make sure you are getting the best care possible. <|endoftext|>

Question: i have been having anxiety attacks trouble sleeping weepyness severe agitation lack of motivation to do anything. i am wondering which of these is the most urgent to get my dr to help me with. are these signs of depression or something else?
Answer: i suggest going to your doctor and describing exactly what you are going through. also if this is not the first time this has happened you need to mention that as well. when you are severely agitated do you feel like you are outside yourself looking in and wanting to stop yourself from doing or saying whatever is going on but it's like you have no control over what you are doing? make a list of all the things that you do or feel so you don't forget like if you have tons of energy out of the blue or go on major shopping sprees or if you feel like no one cares about you or your feelings. search deep within yourself even the things that you hate to think about much less talk about and write it all down and go to your doctor. he may have some options for you. i am no doctor but by what you described is what i used to feel like and then some. i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. i used to get panic attacks all the time but they went away. i'm not diagnosing you but suggesting that you see a doctor. you may just be going through something that happens when the seasons change ironically called seasonal affective disorder (sad. ) <|endoftext|>

Question: what is the defferance betweeb xanax and prozac? . if you are taking xanax for anxiety can you can prozac for it also? which is used for depression?
Answer: xanax is a benzodiazepine & works by slowing down the movement of chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced thus resulting in a reduction in nervous tension. it is usually used to treat anxiety & panic disorders and anxiety caused by depression. prozac is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor "ssri" & is used more for depression. however it is also used to treat anxiety panic & ocd disorders. they have been known to be used together as well as individually. they also are used in conjunction with other types of medications to try to achieve relief. i've also heard that xanax should not be used for long-term as with most "benzos" for fear of dependency. a few good links to look up meds. are: <link> <link> <link> these are the ones i trust the most as i take a boat-load of scripts & when i am prescribed a new one. i look up to see if there may be any interactions with the ones i'm currently taking. hope this helps! <|endoftext|>

Question: what is the defferance betweeb xanax and prozac? . if you are taking xanax for anxiety can you can prozac for it also? which is used for depression?
Answer: prozac an anti-depressant is an ssri (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor). while there are a number of reasons why an individual might take an anti-depressant – the reason cited 90 percent of the time is depression. sadly research has shown that depression has been linked more often than not as a side effect to other medications substance abuse and/or other types of medical conditions – than as a condition on its own. anti-depressants such as abilify zoloft cymbalta and prozac are used to treat depression but unless the reason or cause of the depression is defined and addressed the individual could end up taking the drug indefinitely or worse self-medicating to treat the symptoms. xanax on the other hand is a sedative/tranquilizer and part of the benzodiazepine drug class. although studies have shown that chronic abuse of sedatives and tranquilizers result in the drug’s ineffectiveness many users develop addictive tendencies and without professional assistance cannot stop. long-term use of either/both of these drugs can have lasting effects that can make it very difficult to stop without professional medical detox treatment. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929. <|endoftext|>

Question: i need help finding a specialist and support group in my area for fibromyalgia/ cfs. any suggestions please? . i was diagnosed 10 months ago. my gp has tried to help but has run out of answers and doesn't know who to send me to. i have called all over the place and seen some specialists but they are general specialists. i am hoping to find someone with an interest in fibromyalgia. i also have bad depression and anxiety and my psychiatrist suggested i find a support group. i searched but can not find one in the area. i am feeling hopeless in my search. please help! i live in washington county wisconsin.
Answer: i have had fibromyalgia for thirty years. it is a debilitating condition that had gotten progressively worse through the years. i was at a point where i was physically unable to do most things people take for granted. walking climbing stairs standing from a sitting position had become extremely difficult. the overwhelming pain and stiffness throughout my body was never ending. i spent years going to countless doctors to no avail. the medical community does not have any answers for this condition. i was living on pain medication which had little effect. i tried a support group at a local rehab hospital and did not find it helpful. in fact i found it to be depressing. i have always tried to be positive through this whole ordeal. i never gave up searching for the "cure". i have to admit i was getting discouraged. i had lived most of my life in constant pain something no one can understand unless they have experienced it. it was discouraging to think i would spend the rest of my life like this. my sister called me on day last year stating that she had heard of a local doctor who had opend a practice dedicated to treating pain. he claimed to have a treatment for fibromyalgia. i felt i had nothing to lose so i made an appointment to see him. his name is dr. d'amato. his practice is called calmar pain refief therapy and is located in west warwick rhode island. after the first treatment i felt a difference in my level of pain. i continued for ten more threatments over the course of two weeks. at the end of my treaments the pain and stiffness was almost gone! my level of pain was down 95%. it was my '"cure". i felt i was given my life back. i was able to return to a life i left a long time ago. i started exercising again. before i became disabled by the fibro i was very active and exercised regularly. after my treatment i joined a gym started walking and swimming regularly. i am still working out with a trainer just as i did many years ago. i am recommending anyone with pain to google calmar pain relief therapy. it is almost a year after my treatments and although i have noticed a little regression with some of the pain i am still 85% to 90% pain free. i know you live in another state but it would be worth the trip. plus rhode island is a very pretty state to visit. good luck <|endoftext|>

Question: are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy?
Answer: well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine. <|endoftext|>

Question: my daughter passed away 4 months ago i am having a lot of chest pain and anxiety. i my doctor says im fine is this grief. i have been checked by a cardiologist a 2 months ago. had a stress test done echocardiogram and an ekg. been told i am fine. just don't understand why i am having chest pain if nothing is wrong. it is a stabbing pain that only last a few seconds but comes and goes through out the day.
Answer: i facilitate a griefshare worldwide program that helps people who are grieving a death to find solace and to learn what to expect in the different phases of grief. it can be very normal to develop physical symptoms like you are having. to be a part of a griefshare program go to www. griefshare. org and check in your area by entering your zip code to see if there is one available near you. i have seen it help many to understand that grief is real it is normal after a loss but the good news is that it will end. grieving and missing your loved one is not the same thing. you will stop grieving in time but you will always miss them and thankfully missing them is much easier than the grieving process. my prayer is that you can find a griefshare near you and begin very soon. god bless you <|endoftext|>

Question: is it normal for a patient to have anxiety when having an uncurable severe illness?
Answer: i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease. <|endoftext|>

Question: how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?
Answer: dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar. <|endoftext|>

Question: how should i manage breast changes during pregnancy?
Answer: most pregnant women will feel some changes in their breasts. your breasts will increase in size as your milk glands enlarge and the fat tissue increases causing breast firmness and tenderness in the first and last few months of pregnancy. bluish veins may also appear as your blood supply increases. your nipples will also darken and a thick fluid called colostrum may leak from your breasts. all of these breast changes are normal. recommendations: wear a bra that provides firm support. choose cotton bras or those made from other natural fibers. increase your bra size as your breasts become larger. your bra should fit well without irritating your nipples. try maternity or nursing bras which provide more support and can be used after pregnancy if you choose to breastfeed. to ease discomfort and maintain support try wearing a bra during the night and day. tuck a cotton handkerchief or gauze pad into each bra cup to absorb leaking fluid. nursing pads which you can buy in a pharmacy are also available. make sure to change these pads as needed to prevent irritation to the underlying skin. clean your breasts with warm water only; do not use soap or other products since they can cause dryness. <|endoftext|>

Question: what are the best vitamins for a pregnant woman?
Answer: taking multivitamins during pregnancy is extremely important for proper fetus growth and development. the rda has recommended values of how much of each vitamin and mineral is recommended during pregnancy. there are many brands available on the market as prescription strength and over-the-counter. some are more tailored toward specific women lacking different components than others. a more expensive vitamin is not necessarily better than others. work with your ob-gyn to help select a vitamin that will work best for you. size and cost can play a role in the selection process more importantly to aid in compliance. avoid taking several different supplements. take one multivitamin that includes a variety of necessary nutrients in one dose. combining supplements (such as taking a folic acid supplement along with your multivitamin etc. ) can raise concerns because you run the risk of overdosing on a particular nutrient. taking more than twice the rda of any nutrient should be avoided during pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Question: how much weight should i gain during my pregnancy?
Answer: gaining the right amount of weight during pregnancy by eating a healthy balanced diet is a good sign that your baby is getting all the nutrients he or she needs and is growing at a healthy rate. it is not necessary to "eat for two" during pregnancy. it's true that you need extra calories from nutrient-rich foods to help your baby grow but you generally need to consume only 100 to 300 more calories than you did before you became pregnant to meet the needs of your growing baby. ask your health care provider how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. a woman of average weight before pregnancy should gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. underweight women should gain 28 to 40 pounds during pregnancy. overweight women may need to gain only 15 to 25 pounds during pregnancy. you may need to gain more or less weight depending on what your health care provider recommends. in general you should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during your first three months of pregnancy and 1 pound a week for the remainder of your pregnancy. if you are expecting twins you should gain 35 to 45 pounds during your pregnancy. this would be an average of 1 ½ pounds per week after the usual weight gain in the first three months. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can i get pregnant after i've had an ectopic pregnancy?

Answer: it is possible that this is just a temporary side-effect as your body adjusts to the new drug. i would probably take a few more doses and go from there. i recently started zoloft for anxiety (along with my klonopin which i have been on for 2 years) and i have had no side effects after 5 days. none of the typical gastrointestinal nausea etc. however cymbalta is an snri and zoloft is an ssri. i am not sure but i do believe that snris can come with more side effects. you may want to ask your doctor why an snri was chosen. <|endoftext|> 

Question: whats the difference between anxiety and panic attacks
Answer: the simplistic answer is the the panic attack is the furthest extension of the anxiety. when the anxiety is really bad it forces the autonomic systems of the body (automatic. breathing heart rate blood pressure adrenaline release etc. ) to react in the extreme and you can move into a panic attack. it can happen very quickly and be totally disabling even acting exactly like a heart attack make you think wildly change normal behavior to bizarre want to run hide hurt yourself and more. panic attacks are not anything to ignore. if you are prone to them you should always have a fast acting med with you such as xanax. take it move to a quiet calm place and regain composure. they are frightening and terrifying. best of luck. <|endoftext|>

Answer: i would first need to know what you weigh now. if you reduce your current calorie intake by 500 calories a day theoretically you should lose one pound per week. doing the math you would need to reduce your current caloric intake by 1500 per day but i do not know if this would be medically-advisable or safe for you since i do not know your medical history. before starting any weight reduction program it is best to consult your medical provider first. <|endoftext|> 

Question: my mother is 81 her blood pressure is ranging from 180 over 56 to 205 over 52 it's been over 10 days. she's on three blood pressure medicines and was in the hospital last week we saw the dr he added an anxiety medicine which has not helped he's on vacation what should i do she hate the hospital but i. m worried about damage to her organs or stroke how long can she go with blood pressure this high please
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you're going through this and i'm sorry to hear your physician doesn't have someone covering while he's on vacation. if your mother's blood pressure stays elevated at that level all day long she should get treatment. those numbers are too high and you're right she's at risk for stroke. i also want to say however that as long as your mother understands the risks involved with allowing her blood pressure to remain high and as long as she is not suffering from dementia or some sort of inability to make her own decisions she has the right to refuse treatment. have you discussed with her what her wishes are? does she understand she could suffer serious consequences including death if she doesn't get her blood pressure under control? if she does then you need to accept her wishes. have you discussed your mother's end-of-life wishes with her? it can be a difficult conversation to have but anyone who's 81 years old needs to discuss these things with his or her loved ones. perhaps your mother wants every effort made to preserve her life for as long as possible. or perhaps she wishes to let her life wind down and die as peacefully as possible. those choices are hers but they should be communicated to her family. if you aren't comfortable talking with your mom about this you might consider bringing in a minister nurse or social worker to help have this conversation. you're a wonderful daughter watching out for your mother's health. i wish you both all the best! <|endoftext|> 

Question: i'm 28 yrs old and my chest feels heavy almost like muscle pain in the chest. is it anxiety or something worse?
Answer: unfortunately it's no possible to diagnose this over the internet. although 28 years old sounds young for heart problems it's not impossible. if you're overweight sedentary smoke or have a family history of heart attack then you're at higher risk yourself. if you're having any of these symptoms of a heart attack you should seek emergency medical services by calling 911: crushing pain squeezing sensation or fullness in the mid-chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that comes and goes episodically pain or discomfort that extends beyond your chest particularly pain or discomfort that radiates into the left jaw left arm or left back areas shortness of breath cold sweats nausea anxiety as you can see since anxiety can be a symptom of heart problems it's impossible to distinguish the two via the web. only an ekg and some blood tests can say for sure if the trouble's with your ticker or something else. if you do not feel you're having an acute heart attack you may be ok to simply make an appointment with your health care provider at your earliest convenience. i wish you all the best! <|endoftext|> 

Question: what can i say to a friend while she is having an anxiety attack? . my friend has generalized anxiety disorder and she has panic attacks pretty often. once or twice a week typically and when it's the worst daily. they get bad and it's pretty scary. i was wondering what i can do/say to her that will stop the anxiety attack or make it less bad so she doesn't have to leave class. she has a fear of throwing up that's often what causes the panic attacks even when she just has a stomachache she freaks out. she is on treatment but it can only help so much.
Answer: you are a good person to want to help your friend with her condition. it can be hard to help someone in the moment of a panic attack. one thing you can do is offer to hold her hand and "breathe together. " before attempting this you should practice slow deep breathing on your own so that in the moment of the panic attack you can help your friend regulate her breathing. don't get frustrated if she is unable to breathe as slowly as you are. merely staying calm and encouraging her softly to "breathe in. 2. 3 and breathe out. 2. 3" can be helpful. you may actually be able to help your friend better by finding an activity such as yoga that the two of you can do together when she's not having a panic attack. regular exercise can help anxiety in general and yoga specifically focuses on breathing. by offering to do yoga with your friend you're supporting her in fighting the anxiety problem. your friend should be grateful she has you in her life! good luck to both of you. <|endoftext|>

Answer: i had the same problem severely a few years ago (almost every day to the point that i had to retire early). i improved quite a bit years ago with the help of a service dog who could sense when i was about to have an attack and alert me to take anti-anxiety medicine before the attack happened. however what really helped me at first was to take prophylactic medication until my generalized level of anxiety decreased. (i did relaxation desensitization therapy and other relaxation methods like yoga but it wasn't until the attacks reduced that any of it helped. ) in the meantime the best thing you can do for your friend is to help her with a solution for her real fear - vomiting in public. encourage her to carry a plastic zip-loc bag in her purse (so if she does get sick she won't make a mess that others will have to deal with) and tell her if she feels that she is going to be sick in public you will help her get to a private place to be sick if necessary. there is also an over-the-counter medication called emetrol that will calm the vomiting reflex and allow her to relax and calm down. i still have occasional serious nausea attacks but i always carry at least water and sometimes diet soda to calm my stomach. (for what it's worth i think my extreme anxiety on the subject was caused by a kindergarten classmate who vomited all over me during nap-time. ) the fear of vomiting in public is not typical but it can be very debilitating - and it is much more difficult to treat than a fear of heights or claustrophobia. it is virtually impossible to do progressive desensitization for vomiting - it's kind of difficult to "partially" vomit then relax! <|endoftext|>

Answer: first i validate the fear i. e. 'i know you are terrified. ' being dismissive might intensify their fears. then i listen to the fears. usually the person is aware the fear is some free-floating irrational or undefinable feeling. then i begin reassuring the person that it will end just hang in there. i usually hold their hand or stroke their back. like some have said breathing into a paper bag works well for most people. a tranquilizer works quickly. any facts you can give them also is calming. i list the symptoms and potential solutions so they know what to and what not to expect. i say things like 'it's okay it sounds like you're having an anxiety attack. it will pass. it will not kill you. it is not a heart attack. they come on suddenly and they can leave just as suddenly. you will find your way home (that seems to the one of the symbolic underlying fears). i'm here with you. this won't last forever. it will end. you are safe. ' one thing that seems to help more than anything is to have the person do a physical activity right there in the moment. yoga as one person suggested would be wonderful if the situation allows it. breathing in the bag is another good one. but any task that forces concentration back to the moment puts them in touch with 'reality. ' it's nearly impossible to give energy to the fear when one is doing a physical task. and lastly i have discovered that caffeine often triggers an attack. too much coffee tea soda etc. often is the culprit. so you might want to ask them if they ingested a good deal of caffeine an hour or more before the attack. if so they may have a caffeine allergy. i hope this helps. <|endoftext|>

Answer: let her know that what she is afraid of is not the worst thing in the world. everyone gets sick and if you can get her to understand getting sick in front of everyone will not kill her and she wouldn't be the first she probably will not get sick. have her imagine what she is most afraid of and the most likely resposnse of those around her. chances are she has visions much worse than reality and can understand that. <|endoftext|>

Question: is it safe to take hydroco 5/325 and. 5mg xanax? . i was in an auto accident and broke my ankle/foot wrist and had internal abdomonal injuries and was prescribed hydroco 5/325 for pain. i also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and have been taking. 5 mg of alprazolam per day. are these two medications safe to take at the same time? i take 1 hydroco 5/325 tablet every 4-6 hours for pain and take. 5mg alprazolam per day.
Answer: i'm glad you asked because many others will benefit. you should be just fine taking this combination of medications. you may feel drowsier than normal. and anyone who is taking a narcotic (hydrocodone) should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions. in general though you're not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages. in the future i'd recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time you're prescribed a narcotic. also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice. i hope your ankle heals quickly! <|endoftext|>

Question: what are the first symptoms of atherosclerosis?
Answer: usually first symptoms don't turn up until an artery is narrowed by more than 70%. then you may feel chest pain when you're physically active because the narrowed artery can't deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart. however some people feel no signs or symptoms and don't learn they have atherosclerosis until after a heart attack or stroke. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is there such a thing as angina of the stomach or intestines due to atherosclerosis?
Answer: well not exactly. angina specifically refers to chest pain that occurs when the heart's oxygen supply is reduced. this typically happens due to atherosclerosis which is a hardening and narrowing of the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the body's tissues including the heart. however there is a condition called ischemic bowel (also known as intestinal ischemia dead bowel dead gut and intestinal necrosis). ischemic bowel is caused by a lack of blood flow to the intestines and can cause severe abdominal pain. like angina ischemic bowel also can be caused by atherosclerosis. if you have severe abdominal pain especially if it's accompanied by vomiting diarrhea or fever you should seek medical attention. hope this helps! <|endoftext|> 

Question: what happens to the coronary artery in atherosclerosis?
Answer: in coronary artery disease (coronary atherosclerosis) injury to the intima of the artery leads to the formation of plaques which are regions of thickening on the inner lining of the artery. how then do the plaques form? in response to the injury the smooth muscle cells from the media and perhaps from the adventitia move (migrate) into the intima. in the intima these smcs reproduce themselves (divide) and make (synthesize) connective tissue. these processes of migration division and synthesis which collectively are referred to as intimal proliferation (build-up) cause thickening of the intima. when cholesterol other fats and inflammatory cells such as white blood cells enter the proliferating thickened intima the result is an atherosclerotic plaque. then as these plaques grow they accumulate scar (fibrous) tissue and abundant calcium. (calcium is the hard material in our teeth and bones. ) hence the plaques are often hard which is why atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to as "hardening of the arteries. " <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is atherosclerosis?
Answer: atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. cholesterol plaques cause hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. the atherosclerosis process begins early in life (as early as teens in some people). when atherosclerosis is mild and the arteries are not substantially narrowed atherosclerosis causes no symptoms. therefore many adults are typically unaware that their arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. but when atherosclerosis becomes advanced with aging it can cause critical narrowing of the arteries resulting in tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen). arteries that are narrowed by advanced atherosclerosis can cause diseases in different organs. for example advanced atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (arteries that supply heart muscles) can lead to angina and heart attacks. advanced atherosclerosis of the carotid and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain) can lead to strokes and transient ischemic attacks (tias). advanced atherosclerosis in the lower extremities can lead to pain while walking or exercising (claudication) deficient wound healing and/or leg ulcers. atherosclerosis is often generalized meaning it affects arteries throughout the body. therefore patients with heart attacks are also more likely to develop strokes and peripheral vascular disease and vice versa. <|endoftext|>

Answer: i have anxiety attacks too. i think since she is aware of the issue the first thing is to remind her that she is having one. that may sound infantile but the truth is we dont know (looking from the outside in) if we are having an attack or if it is real. how we are observed and precieved by people we trust is how we get back in touch with our core and make the effort to calm down. also some simple gesture like a cup of tea together or something appropirate for the time and location. she is so lucky to have you! <|endoftext|> 

Question: how does atherosclerosis affect the body?
Answer: hardening of the arteries is a leading cause of sickness and death in the united states. in 2005 roughly 870 000 people in this country died of cardiovascular disease largely caused by atherosclerotic problems. atherosclerosis can lead to both heart attacks and stroke. and it can also do damage to the legs kidneys and intestines. when plaque hardens and narrows arteries that supply blood to the legs they may cramp and feel weak when you walk or run. when atherosclerosis affects arteries to the kidney and intestines the inadequate blood flow can damage organ tissues. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how does atherosclerosis cause disease?
Answer: there are two ways atherosclerosis causes disease. 1) atherosclerosis can limit the ability of the narrowed arteries to increase delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues during periods of increased oxygen demand such as during exertion. 2) complete obstruction of an artery by a thrombus or embolus (thrombus and embolus are forms of blood clots) resulting in tissue necrosis (death of tissue). exertional angina and intermittent claudication are two examples of insufficient delivery of blood and oxygen to meet tissue demand. strokes and heart attacks are examples of death of tissue caused by complete artery obstruction by blood clots. there are many similarities between coronary artery diseases (atherosclerosis involving the arteries of the heart) and peripheral artery disease. for example patients with exertional angina typically have no symptoms at rest. but during exertion the critically narrowed coronary arteries are incapable of increasing blood and oxygen delivery to meet the increased oxygen needs of the heart muscles. lack of blood and oxygen causes chest pain (exertional angina). exertional angina typically subsides when the patient rests. in patients with intermittent claudication the narrowed arteries in the lower extremities (for example a narrowed artery at the groin) cannot increase blood and oxygen delivery to the calf muscles during walking. these patients experience pain in the calf muscles that will only subside after resting. patients with unstable angina have critically narrowed coronary arteries that cannot deliver enough blood and oxygen to the heart muscle even at rest. these patients have chest pain at rest and are at imminent risk of developing heart attacks. patients with severe artery occlusion in the legs can develop rest pain (usually in the feet). rest pain represents such severe occlusion that there is insufficient blood supply to the feet even at rest. they are at risk of developing foot ulcers and gangrene. when the arteries are narrowed as a result of atherosclerosis blood tends to clot in the narrowed areas forming a so-called thrombus (plural thrombi). sometimes pieces of the thrombi break off and travel in the bloodstream until they are trapped in a narrower point in the artery beyond which they cannot pass. a thrombus or piece of thrombus that travels to another point is called an embolus (pleural emboli). thrombi and emboli can cause sudden and complete artery blockage leading to tissue necrosis (death of tissue). for example complete blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes heart attack while complete blockage of a carotid or cerebral artery causes ischemic stroke. emboli originating from atherosclerosis in the aorta (the main artery delivering blood to the body) can obstruct small arteries in the feet resulting in painful and blue (cyanotic) toes foot ulcers and even gangrene. <|endoftext|> 

Question: does chewing tobacco increase the risk of atherosclerosis?
Answer: yes. like smoking chewing tobacco and snuff also boost the chances of getting atherosclerosis. even secondhand smoke seems to raise risk. smoking causes blood levels of carbon monoxide to go up which may in turn increase risk of damage to artery linings. tobacco use also raises ldl "bad" cholesterol and lowers hdl"good" cholesterol constricts arteries and further decreases blood flow to tissues and makes blood more likely to clot. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what factors put you at risk for atherosclerosis?

Question: when does the coronary atherosclerosis process begin?
Answer: although the coronary arteries are wide open at birth the atherosclerosis process begins early in life. between the ages of 10 and 20 "fatty streaks" are already being deposited on the inner lining of the coronary arteries. over the years some of these fatty streaks grow into larger cholesterol plaques that can protrude into the artery lumen and harden the artery walls. many men and women between the ages of 20 and 30 typically are unaware that their coronary arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. but by ages 40 to 50 many people have developed enough atherosclerosis to put them at risk for coronary heart disease. <|endoftext|> 

Question: have most people done enough to prevent atherosclerosis and heart attacks?
Answer: atherosclerosis prevention should start early preferably during childhood and adolescence. most scientists believe that preventing atherosclerosis is more effective than trying to reverse established blockages or getting rid of plaques in the arteries. therefore children and adolescents should be taught lifetime habits of regular exercise avoidance of smoking and good nutrition. unfortunately many americans have not taken adequate steps to prevent atherosclerosis. reasons for this failure include: lack of awareness that they already have coronary atherosclerosis and ignorance that coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks are preventable. lack of awareness of their blood cholesterol levels and profiles. unwillingness or inability to quit cigarette smoking. high blood pressure or diabetes that are either undiagnosed or inadequately controlled. lack of exercise an excess of fat and cholesterol in their diet and an inability to lose excess weight. failure to take full advantage of medications that improve cholesterol profiles usually out of fear of potential side effects. <|endoftext|> 

Question: aside from atherosclerosis what are the other causes of peripheral vascular diseases?
Answer: atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries (pad) is by far the most common cause of peripheral vascular disease. but a number of conditions such as vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels occurring either as a primary condition or associated with connective tissue diseases such as lupus) may cause damage to blood vessels throughout the body. injuries to blood vessels (from accidents such as auto accidents or sports injuries) blood-clotting disorders and damage to blood vessels during surgery can also lead to tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen). tissue ischemia can also occur in the absence of atherosclerosis or other abnormalities of arteries. one example of a condition in which the blood vessels themselves are not damaged is raynaud's disease which is believed to occur due to spasms in blood vessels brought on by stress tobacco smoking or a cold environment. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are the risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attack?
Answer: factors that increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart attacks include increased blood cholesterol high blood pressure use of tobacco diabetes mellitus male gender and a family history of coronary heart disease. while family history and male gender are genetically determined the other risk factors can be modified through changes in lifestyle and medications. high blood cholesterol (hyperlipidemia). a high level of cholesterol in the blood is associated with an increased risk of heart attack because cholesterol is the major component of the plaques deposited in arterial walls. cholesterol like oil cannot dissolve in the blood unless it is combined with special proteins called lipoproteins. (without combining with lipoproteins cholesterol in the blood would turn into a solid substance. ) the cholesterol in blood is either combined with lipoproteins as very low-density lipoproteins (vldl) low-density lipoproteins (ldl) or high-density lipoproteins (hdl). the cholesterol that is combined with low-density lipoproteins (ldl cholesterol) is the "bad" cholesterol that deposits cholesterol in arterial plaques. thus elevated levels of ldl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart attack. the cholesterol that is combined with hdl (hdl cholesterol) is the "good" cholesterol that removes cholesterol from arterial plaques. thus low levels of hdl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart attacks. measures that lower ldl cholesterol and/or increase hdl cholesterol (losing excess weight diets low in saturated fats regular exercise and medications) have been shown to lower the risk of heart attack. one important class of medications for treating elevated cholesterol levels (the statins) have actions in addition to lowering ldl cholesterol which also protect against heart attack. most patients at "high risk" for a heart attack should be on a statin no matter what the levels of their cholesterol. high blood pressure (hypertension). high blood pressure is a risk factor for developing atherosclerosis and heart attack. both high systolic pressure (when the heart beats) and high diastolic pressure (when the heart is at rest) increase the risk of heart attack. it has been shown that controlling hypertension with medications can reduce the risk of heart attack. tobacco use (smoking). tobacco and tobacco smoke contain chemicals that cause damage to blood vessel walls accelerate the development of atherosclerosis and increase the risk of heart attack. diabetes (diabetes mellitus). both insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2 respectively) are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis throughout the body. therefore patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for reduced blood flow to the legs coronary heart disease erectile dysfunction and strokes at an earlier age than non-diabetic people. patients with diabetes can lower their risk through rigorous control of their blood sugar levels regular exercise weight control and proper diets. male gender. at all ages men are more likely than women to develop atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. some scientists believe that this difference is partly due to the higher blood levels of hdl cholesterol in women than in men. however this gender difference narrows as men and women grow older. family history of heart disease. individuals with a family history of coronary heart disease have an increased risk of heart attack. specifically the risk is higher if there is a family history of early coronary heart disease including a heart attack or sudden death before age 55 in the father or other first-degree male relative or before age 65 in the mother or other female first-degree female relative. <|endoftext|>

Answer: scarring results from a either a tear in the dermis (stretch marks) or an overgrowth of collagen with raised scars (keloids ). there is really no way to prevent scars completely. if you are genetically predisposed to scar formation you probably will have a scar. once a keloid scar develops intervene early (before the scar is raised and thickened) and massage your scar frequently with a vitamin e based moisturizer; this helps break down additional collagen build-up. during pregnancy remain well-hydrated in order to keep the dermis healthy and less susceptible to tearing also moisturize with a vitamin e based moisturizer. <|endoftext|>

Answer: baby : your baby is still very small only about 0. 014 inches to 0. 04 inches in length. the embryo probably in about its second week of development has multiplied to about 150 cells. your baby is being nourished by secretions from the uterine lining. layers of cells already are specialized according to functions. the outer layer will become the nervous system skin and hair; the inner layer will be the breathing and digestive organs; and the middle layer will become the skeleton bones cartilage muscles circulatory system kidneys and sex organs. mom-to-be : you're probably expecting your period this week and if it doesn't occur it might be one of the first signs that you're pregnant. you may also notice light spotting as the embryo implants itself in your uterus. you might not feel any different yet but the amniotic cavity which will be filled with fluid and the placenta which will bring oxygen and nutrients to nourish your baby are forming in your uterus. tip for the week : try to eat healthfully which means choosing a variety of foods from the recommended food groups and drinking at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. but you don't really need to "eat for two. " you need only an extra 300 calories per day during pregnancy. and don't worry if your food intake drops a little in the beginning because of morning sickness. if you've been eating right already your baby will get what it needs. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what can i expect during week 3 of my pregnancy?
Answer: baby : congratulations! if your egg and your partner's sperm have joined successfully your embryo is really there although it's very small -- about the size of the head of a pin. it doesn't look like a fetus or baby; it's just a group of about 100 cells multiplying and growing rapidly. the outer layer of cells will become the placenta and the inner layer will become the embryo. mom-to-be : you won't notice any changes. it's too soon. remember you haven't even missed your period yet. tip for the week : home pregnancy tests are about as reliable as a urine test or blood test done in the doctor's office and can give you more immediate results than waiting for a doctor's visit. to ensure accuracy make sure you've read the directions carefully and that all equipment being used is clean. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what can i expect during weeks 1 and 2 of my pregnancy?
Answer: baby : your baby is still just a glimmer in your eye. although it's confusing to think about a pregnancy starting before your child is even conceived doctors calculate your due date from the beginning of your last cycle since it's hard to know exactly when conception occurred. mom-to-be : at the beginning of a cycle about 20 eggs called ova begin to ripen and occupy fluid-filled sacs called follicles. one of these follicles matures and ruptures releasing an egg that will travel down the fallopian tube where it awaits fertilization. this all takes place about 14 days before the end of your cycle. this is the time you're most fertile so light some candles take the phone off the hook and set aside some intimate time. an egg can be fertilized for only about 12 to 24 hours once the ovum is released. don't be disappointed if it doesn't work the first time. you have only about a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month. tip for the week : make sure you've scheduled a preconception visit with your ob-gyn to determine risks of genetic diseases environmental hazards and lifestyle changes necessary to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby. most important make sure you've started taking 0. 4 milligrams or 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. folic acid taken a few months before conception has been shown to dramatically reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are the effects of lack of sex? . is sex deprivation. documented. to cause any harm. i am a 41 male suffering from depression anxiety ocd and panic attacks. i have extremely strong sexual urges but i have been suppressing them and i wonder if this could contribute to or exaggerate my depressive suffering. could you please recommend other sources to learn more about this or any website which offer help to the likes of me. i have been jobless for a long time and can't afford expensive therapy so any free help will be great.
Answer: i do not believe that sex deprivation causes harm. countless people on this planet are celebate like priests or nuns and are quite well-adjusted. humans have many biological urges. if a person cuts you off in traffic you may want to cause him harm but you do not. as a child in a candy store you may have the urge to steal candy but you don't. you have strong sexual urges and you may be having difficulty dealing with them. because you also have depression anxiety ocd and panic attacks all of these feelings may be overwhelming you. yes you do need some help. i am sorry but i am not aware of any web sites that deal with sexual deprivation but this would not be the way to go for you. i do not know if you are a religious man but you may be able to find help through a church or church-sponsored organization. many communities have community mental health facilities that can provide some immediate and long-term care for you perhaps in the way of medications or counseling. rather than spend time on the internet searching for sites that deal with sexual deprivation devote this time to help yourself find the proper care in your area. i am confident that you will find help. <|endoftext|>

Answer: there has not been to my knowledge any studies showing that sexual deprivation causes any harm. i am a 59yr old male with depression anxiety paruresis ocd & eating disorders ( ocd stopped when i began to take antidepressants clean from eating disorders for some five yrs). also the medications i take greatly lessen my sexual impulses (which i don't mind since i never acted on them). the main problem is to focus on the problems which are definitely affecting your quality of life such as the depression & anxiety. these may be a major reason why you have trouble keeping a job. contact your local federal office to see if you qualify for ssi and medical aid so you can see a qualified therapist and psychologist to get help for your emotional problems. these doctors should also be able to help you with your sexual worries. i wish you all the best my friend. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what should i do if i am gaining too much weight during my pregnancy?
Answer: if you have gained more weight than recommended during the beginning of your pregnancy talk to your medical provider. in most cases it is not appropriate to intentionally attempt to lose weight during pregnancy. be sure to eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients you and your baby need. here are some tips to slow your weight gain: when eating out at a fast food restaurant choose lower fat items such as broiled chicken breast sandwich with tomato and lettuce (no sauce or mayonnaise) side salad with low-fat dressing plain bagels or a plain baked potato. avoid fried foods such as french fries mozzarella sticks or breaded chicken patties. avoid whole milk products. you need at least four servings of milk products every day. however using skim 1% or 2% milk will greatly reduce the amount of calories and fat you eat. also choose low-fat or fat-free cheese or yogurt. limit sweet or sugary drinks. sweetened drinks such as soft drinks fruit punch fruit drinks iced tea lemonade or powdered drink mixes provide many calories with little nutrients. choose water club soda or mineral water to avoid extra calories. do not add salt to foods when cooking. salt causes your body to retain water. limit sweets and high calorie snacks. cookies candies donuts cakes syrup honey and potato chips provide many calories with little nutrition. try not to eat these types of foods every day. instead try fresh fruit low-fat yogurt angel food cake with strawberries or pretzels as lower calorie snack and dessert choices. use fats in moderation. fats include cooking oils margarine butter gravy sauces mayonnaise regular salad dressings sauces lard sour cream and cream cheese. try the lower fat substitutes that are available for these foods. prepare meals using low-fat cooking methods. frying foods in oil or butter will increase the calories and fat of that meal. baking broiling grilling or boiling are healthier lower fat methods of cooking. exercise. moderate exercise as recommended by your health care provider can help burn excess calories. walking or swimming is generally safe effective exercises for pregnant women. but be sure to talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program. <|endoftext|> 

Question: my teen has anxiety which is controlled by medication but dr wants to take him off the medication. why? is this safe? . my son was having hallucinations and was given antipsychotic meds 18 mos ago. 8 mos ago he was dx with anxiety and rx anxiety meds. he hasn't had hallucinations since. 2 months ago dr stopped antipsych meds. he is currently taking anxiety meds. hes doing very well and still no hallucinations. dr wants to lower dose of anxiety meds til he is no longer on med. his anixety was so severe it caused hallucinations. is it possible for a teen to outgrow anxiety to the point no med is necessary?
Answer: i am only 18 and i suffered from anxiety much like that when i was 16. i went to a counsler & a therapist. they had put me on medication for anxiety as well. i took the medication for about a year and i was noticing great improvements! sometimes anxiety is simply caused by something in your life that is bothering you or stressing you out. once that problem is fixed or seems to get better sometimes the anxiety can get better or even go away. i took myself off of the medication that i was prescribed. i have anxiety attacks once & awhile but nothing like i used to. i dont think that it is harmful unless he has a very severe condition. i would talk to his doctor about it & make sure that it is the right decision before anything is acted upon. <|endoftext|>

Answer: i and my 9 year old son suffer from bipolar disorder which also can come with anxiety issues so i can understand your concern. in all honesty i must give your doctor kudos for wanting to wean your teen off the medication. many doctors who hand out meds for mental or mood disorders are like drug pushers. the trouble with some of these drugs aside from the numerous and ill side effects in teens and young adults is that as your child grows and their chemistry changes these drugs are no longer effective. then you have to try a different drug until you face the same issue. it's a vicious cycle and the one suffering the most is the child who is beginning to feel much like a guinea pig by this point. my advice is to give it a try to see how it works out. if you have concerns about the anxiety returning perhaps the doctor would be willing to provide something to be taken in cases of extreme anxiety. and if it turns out that this situation isn't working out you can ask for your teen to be put back on meds. please remember teen years are very anxious times for all children in teen years. i experienced it myself and my own teen is currently having issues. sometimes the best medicine is to assure them that they're normal and everything will work itself out. anxiety attacks are scary and can escalate into all sorts of fears (like those of being in the process of dying). it helps to be reminded that it's only an anxiety attack not death and it will pass once they calm themselves. i wish you all the luck! <positive_smiley> <|endoftext|>

Answer: often medications taken over a period of time tend not to effective. since your son seems to be doing better there is no need to continue medications as they are. the doctor is doing the right thing by reducing medicatipns to the lowest effective level. it is much better to dose down than to dose up. too mich medication when not needed can be detrimental. be happy your son is showing signs of improvrment which is not always the case. patrick4287 <|endoftext|>

Question: how can the health risks of teen pregnancy be lowered?
Answer: if you are a teenager who is pregnant here is how to ensure a healthy teen pregnancy: get early prenatal care. call your doctor for your first prenatal visit as soon as you think you might be pregnant. if you can't afford to see a doctor ask your school nurse or counselor to help you find a low-cost clinic and other resources. for example they can help you find state medicaid or wic (women infants and children) programs. stay away from alcohol drugs and cigarettes. these harm a growing fetus even more than they harm a growing teenager. if you're not able to quit by yourself ask for help from someone you trust. take a prenatal vitamin with at least 0. 4 mg of folic acid every day to help prevent birth defects. ideally this should start before you get pregnant. ask for emotional support. being a mother brings untold emotional and practical challenges -- especially for teens still in school. reach out to others -- your friends family the baby's father -- for emotional and practical support. for teenagers who are healthy and strong chances are good of delivering a healthy strong baby -- especially with early prenatal care and a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are the medical risks and emotional realities of teen pregnancy?
Answer: pregnant teens and their unborn babies have unique medical risks. lack of prenatal care teenage girls who are pregnant -- especially if they don't have support from their parents -- are at risk of not getting adequate prenatal care. prenatal care is critical especially in the first months of pregnancy. prenatal care screens for medical problems in both mother and baby monitors the growth of the baby and deals quickly with any complications that arise. prenatal vitamins with folic acid -- ideally taken before getting pregnant -- are key in helping to help prevent certain birth defects such as neural tube defects. high blood pressure pregnant teens have a higher risk of getting high blood pressure -- called pregnancy-induced hypertension -- than pregnant women in their 20s or 30s. they also have a higher risk of preeclampsia. this is a dangerous medical condition that combines high blood pressure with excess protein in the urine swelling of a mother's hands and face and organ damage. these medical risks affect the pregnant teen who may need to take medications to control symptoms. but they can also disrupt the unborn baby's growth. and they can lead to further pregnancy complications such as premature birth. premature birth a full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. a baby that delivers before 37 weeks is a premature baby or "preemie. " in some cases premature labor that begins too early in pregnancy can be stopped by medications and bedrest. other times the baby has to be delivered early for the health of the mother or infant. the earlier a baby is born the more risk there is of respiratory digestive vision cognitive and other problems. low-birth-weight baby teens are at higher risk of having low-birth-weight babies. premature babies are more likely to weigh less than they should. in part that’s because they've had less time in the womb to grow. a low-birth-weight baby weighs only 3. 3 to 5. 5 pounds (1 500 to 2 500 grams). a very-low-birth-weight baby weighs less than 3. 3 pounds. babies that small may need to be put on a ventilator in a hospital's neonatal care unit for help with breathing after birth. stds (sexually transmitted diseases) for teens who have sex during pregnancy stds such as chlamydia and hiv are a major concern. using a latex condom during intercourse helps prevent getting an std -- which is especially critical during pregnancy. it’s critical because stds can rise up through the cervix and infect the uterus and growing baby. postpartum depression pregnant teens may be at higher risk of postpartum depression (depression that starts after delivering a baby) says the cdc. girls who feel down and sad either while pregnant or after the birth should talk openly with their doctors or someone else they trust. depression can interfere with taking good care of a newborn -- and with healthy teenage development -- but it can be treated. feeling alone and isolated especially for teens who think they can't tell their parents they're pregnant feeling scared isolated and alone can be a real problem. without the support of family or other adults pregnant teens are less likely to eat well exercise or get plenty of rest. and they are less likely to get to their regular prenatal visits. having at least one trusted supportive adult -- someone nearby in the community if not a family member -- is invaluable in helping them get the prenatal care and emotional support they need to stay healthy during this time. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are the signs and symptoms that a teen might be pregnant?
Answer: missing one or more menstrual periods is the classic sign of pregnancy. but this can be tricky for teenage girls whose periods aren't yet regular. it can also be tricky for girls whose cycles are off as a result of excessive dieting or exercise or low body fat from sports or anorexia. the full list of pregnancy signs includes: a missed menstrual period nausea or vomiting -- called "morning sickness " though it can happen throughout the day sudden intense aversion to certain foods especially meats or fatty fried foods sore nipples or breasts unusual fatigue frequent urination unusual mood swings. of course a positive pregnancy test is another sign of pregnancy. today's home pregnancy tests are generally considered accurate. these simple kits can be bought over the counter in drugstores. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how much weight should i gain during pregnancy?
Answer: pregnancy doesn't equal a get-out-of-jail-free card for a caloric spending spree. if you gain too much weight you're at risk for conditions like gestational diabetes; too little and your baby may be born at a low birth weight. what's "just right" for you? if you're at a normal weight before pregnancy gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. if you are overweight before pregnancy gain 15 to 25 pounds. if you are underweight prior to pregnancy gain 28 to 40 pounds. for multiple births consult your doctor (usually you should gain about 35 to 45 pounds for twins). the average woman should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during her first three months of pregnancy and 1 pound a week for the remainder of her pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Answer: i had really bad anxiety in high school. when i was around 18 i had constant panic attacks. i was put on medication. it's possible your doctor feels that the medication is no longer necessary if your teen was on the medication long enough. also if your teen is trying new things to relieve their anxieties such as art music exercise. your teen needs a healthy way to relieve anxiety. therapy can help too. i would talk to your teen though to make sure it wasn't what they wanted. maybe your teen feels they don't need it and wants to be taken off the meds? <|endoftext|> 

Question: what should and shouldn't i eat while i'm pregnant?
Answer: while pregnant you're eating for two as the old saying goes -- but just what are you two supposed to be eating? get all essential vitamins and minerals daily. take prenatal vitamins and eat a healthy diet. fill your plate with leafy greens fruits veggies and whole grains (like wheat breads and cereals). get plenty of calcium-rich foods such as broccoli and low-fat milk and yogurt. stick to lean meats like chicken and turkey. foods to avoid during pregnancy include: fish with lots of mercury such as swordfish tilefish and shark. cut back on tuna and snapper to no more than one serving a week. but you can eat up to two servings of fish such as salmon catfish mahi mahi and cod along with shellfish like shrimp crab and scallops. raw fish. unpasteurized soft cheeses like brie camembert feta gorgonzola and roquefort. they may contain bacteria called listeria that can cross the placenta. unpasteurized milk which can also contain listeria. cold ready-to-eat meats like hot dogs and luncheon meats; these can also contain listeria. reheat these foods until they are steaming. uncooked or cured eggs and meats such as prosciutto runny eggs and sauces made with raw eggs (like some hollandaises). alcohol. there is no known safe level of exposure to alcohol for a fetus. caffeine. large amounts of caffeine have been linked to premature birth and low birth weight. if you can't cut it out entirely limit intake to 300 milligrams per day or less (one to two cups of coffee). <|endoftext|> 

Question: what activities should i not do while pregnant?
Answer: change the cat's litter box. cat feces can transmit an infection called toxoplasmosis which can lead to severe problems in newborns including low birth weight jaundice mental retardation and convulsions. use saunas hot tubs and tanning booths. excessive heat can be harmful to the baby and has been linked to spinal malformations. paint. let somebody else paint the baby's room; pregnant women shouldn't be exposed to toxic substances and chemicals which include paint and cleaning solvents. get an x-ray. unless you absolutely have to avoid tests like x-rays and mammograms while pregnant which can be dangerous to your growing baby. if you absolutely must have an x-ray make sure that your doctor or dentist knows you are pregnant so they can take extra precautions. ride the great american scream machine or the tower of terror. there is concern that the rapid stops and jarring forces of rides like this could cause placental abruption (premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall). play it safe and stick to the ferris wheel until the baby's born. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what should i do before i get pregnant to ensure a healthy pregnancy for me and my baby?
Answer: a typical pregnancy is nine months long but to give your baby a healthy start think of it as twelve months -- including the three months before you get pregnant. this means that when you start thinking about trying to conceive you should: see your doctor for a prepregnancy checkup. don't forget to ask about things like family medical history risk of birth defects genetic conditions and chronic illnesses. discuss all the medications you take and make sure they're safe during pregnancy. in addition to eating a healthy diet (lots of leafy greens lean proteins and fiber) boost your nutrients with a prenatal vitamin. it's particularly important to get sufficient folic acid before getting pregnant. this nutrient helps prevent birth defects like spina bifida. look for a multivitamin that contains 400 micrograms of calcium. if you smoke quit. smoking poses a host of risks to a developing baby including birth defects and low birth weight. it also doubles your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy. get checked for hepatitis b and c sexually transmitted infections and hiv. get any health problems -- like diabetes and high blood pressure -- under control. if you are seriously overweight talk to your doctor about how to maintain a healthy weight. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is it safe to take 2 50 mg of seroquel with 75 mg of zoloft? . i originally take 50 mg of seroquel and 50 mg of zoloft but they told me i could take 75 mg of zoloft if i needed too today my depression and anxiety got so bad that i feel like i need 75 and i cant sleep so i wanna increase my seroquel to 100 mg cause 50 isnt letting me sleep but my question is is it safe? im 17 years old and i weight 94 lbs
Answer: it's safe if your doctor said it is and only then. adjusting your medication on your own can cause severe side effects especially if you're using multiple at the same time. because of your low weight they may not be able to increase it much either. give them a call if you feel you need to have a change made -usually you can talk over the phone or they can squeeze you in. also remember neither of these are fast-acting medications so increasing your dosage suddenly won't do much. coping skills are your best option for quick and near instant results though medication will help you in the long run. source: three-ish years of being on anxiety/depression medication in conjunction with an eating disorder. i've also seen around five different psychiatrists. <|endoftext|> 

Question: why is caffeine considered a "drug" during pregnancy?
Answer: caffeine is legal and prevalent in foods such as chocolate and drinks such as coffee and sodas. but experts claim it's still a drug and should be limited. caffeine has been a controversial subject in fda guidelines. in the early 1980s the fda released a study that stated caffeine use had toxic results in studies of rats. however this warning has since been loosened a bit. pregnant women who need caffeine should regulate their intake. it can cause low birth weight and irritability if taken in large quantities. <|endoftext|> 

Question: does drinking during pregnancy cause fetal alcohol syndrome?

Answer: yes some antidepressants and cardiac medications can interfere with sexual activity so please discuss this openly with your doctor since i do not know what meds are you are taking. the size of your penis should not be drastically changing no more than your hands or feet getting smaller. it may seem that way if you are having erectile problems. this is another common male disorder that may be able to be rectified but any use of ed meds will need to be prescribed by your doctor -- someone who knows your medical history the medications you are taking and can examine you. <|endoftext|> 

Question: just started zoloft. doctor rxd abilify 2mg for one month to deal with anxiety assoc. with starting ssri. is this safe? . i have taken 1mg of clonazepam daily for 2 years with much success. i decided to start zoloft to deal with some panic attacks at work. when the doc suggested abilify for one month to ease anxiety that can come with the first month of an ssri i was surprised. this is an atypical antipsychotic and it seemed like overkill. is 2mg abilify for one month safe? do i need to worry about tardive dyskinesia?
Answer: you raise some good questions. in fact they're good questions to take up with your doctor. you have a right to have all your questions answered before beginning any medication therapy. i'd suggest you call your doctor or make an appointment to go over your concerns about the abilify prescription. that said i'm also confident your doctor wouldn't prescribe a drug combination he or she believed to be unsafe. however it's never a bad idea to double-check and go over your complete list of current medications because doctors today are overworked and it's easy to overlook something. hope this helps! <|endoftext|> 

Question: what can i expect during week 18 of my pregnancy?

Answer: if you haven't tried any medications for this disorder then i would recommend speaking with your doctor about getting on an anti-anxiety medication like clonazepam. a lot of times there are things in our life that can increase our anxiety and cause panic attacks. if you have a particularly stressful job then you may need to consider scaling back your work or even moving into another field of work that won't affect your physical and mental health. if medication does not work for you then it would be a good idea to start seeing a therapist or psychiatrist possibly on a weekly basis or more to start to work through the triggers that cause anxiety and panic episodes. <|endoftext|>

Answer: if you have symptoms of a stroke it's important to seek immediate medical attention. one-sided weakness can be a sign of stroke. here are other common symptoms: sudden vision changes sudden problems walking sudden severe headache sudden inability to speak most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case. if your one-sided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor. i can't think of any reason why anxiety would cause one-sided weakness. i suppose it's possible it could be a medication side-effect but this still deserves to be checked out. i suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible. best wishes to you! <|endoftext|>

Answer: i also have severe anxiety. i am only 17 so i do not know what a drunk/high feeling is like. however i am familiar with the spaced out sensation. these are factors that contributed to my spaced out feeling: hyperventalating chronic insomnia comorbidity in the anxiety spectrum (adhd in my case) in addition depending on what form of anxiety you have perhaps your worried thoughts are always on your mind and thus prevent you from staying in the moment. this was true for me - i have ocd. i think it would be in your best interest to see a psychiatrist. <|endoftext|>

(this crown-to-rump length is used more often than crown-to-heel length because the baby's legs are most often bent and hard to measure). the eyes and limb buds also are forming. a heartbeat can sometimes be detected by an ultrasound around now. this is also an extremely important time in the development of your baby since between 17 and 56 days the embryo is most susceptible to factors that can interfere with its normal growth. mom-to-be : you may have gained a few pounds by now but if you're experiencing morning sickness you may have lost weight which is also normal. you're starting to notice some changes in your body: clothes getting a little tighter around the waist weight gain in your legs and breasts. with a pelvic exam your practitioner will be able to notice a change in the size of your uterus. tip for the week : make sure you're following good prenatal habits like eating right and taking your prenatal vitamins. since the neural tube (which is the beginning of the central nervous system) has formed by now taking folic acid to prevent spinal cord defects such as spina bifida has been crucial. if you haven't already stop smoking and drinking. <|endoftext|>

Question: my husband is on xanax klonopin and pristiq for anxiety and depression. he was also given vicodin. is this too much? . our family doctor prescribed vicodin for my hubby's severe back pain (multiple curvatures of the spine).
Answer: whenever someone is taking medications for specific problems such as psychiatric or orthopedic pain it would seem a good idea to refer to a specialist. i'm not an m. d. but certainly someone who specializes in disorders of the spine other than a surgeon should be consulted on your husband's case and might make recommendations as to alternative medications and some course of physical therapy. the xanax and klonopin that he is on may be used for muscle relief too. it is really in someone's clinical judgment where determinations are made regarding which medications to prescribe and a general practitioner may not have the expertise required. my recommendation therefore would be to consider a second opinion with specialists in the areas where he needs help. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i am having a sudden sharp chest pain that feels like my heart is being stabbed with needles. could anxiety cause that?

Question: i have had anxiety/depression for over 12 years. i've taken so many medicines. how can i find the right one for me?
Answer: one thing we know for sure and that's that no medication works for everyone. it's unfortunate but there has to be a period of trial-and-error in order to find the right medication or combination of medications that may work for you. you also have to consider the fact that you may not really need medication at all. remember sometimes learning to help yourself and to cope differently with things that are happening in your life can be very effective in curbing anxiety. you indicated it has been 12 years now that you've had this diagnosis and i'm wondering what besides medication has been tried in order to help you. has anyone suggested cognitive therapy mild exercise self-help techniques or lifestyle changes? unfortunately sometimes treatment plans do not include all of these aspects and i believe that may lead to an inadequate result. hopefully you are working with an experienced psychiatrist. i would think however that there are things you can do for yourself. . review your current lifestyle and see if some changes might be helpful. sometimes this is one of the simplest things to do and can have the most dramatic result. <|endoftext|>

Question: my primary doctor diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and prescribed xanax and zoloft. why do i still have panic attacks?
Answer: i'm a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and i don't feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication. it may require medication but first i believe other things should be attempted. first i think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on. have you considered what might be happening in your life lately? remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you. the medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks. since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective. there are of course other older medications which can be just as effective. it looks like your doctor was providing "bridge therapy" which means he was providing the xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective. research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though we've never had them before. this may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more. it may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age. for that reason i suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you <|endoftext|> 

Question: my primary doctor diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and prescribed xanax and zoloft. why do i still have panic attacks?
Answer: i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. i’ve been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot! <|endoftext|> 

Question: i’m a 29-yr-old female with adhd depression and anxiety. willl my adhd be affected by my planned ivf? . i can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me.
Answer: you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications. first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co-existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy. when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co-existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment. some co-existing conditions such as mild depression/demoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated. however some stimulants may make anxiety (or depression) worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety. in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd. this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxiety/self-esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason. that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd. basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus. there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy. if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and ob/gyn and wean off any stimulant treatment. <|endoftext|>

Question: years ago i had severe anxiety depression and couldn't leave my house. it’s back and i need medicine. is this normal?
Answer: medication alone doesn't always provide sufficient help and we know that cognitive therapy is often vital to help you improve your situation. since you are receiving medication has your prescriber not recommended that you also be in cognitive therapy? i believe this individual should provide a referral for you and the person to whom you are referred should be highly experienced in both anxiety and depression treatment. i also think that you could benefit from using some self-help techniques. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i am unemployed and can’t get insurance. i have social anxiety gad and depression. how can i get help i can't afford?
Answer: a lack of insurance and an inability to pay more than a minimal amount should never prevent you from getting the help you need and deserve. licensed professionals including psychologists have an ethical responsibility to take a number of "pro-bono" cases. this means for little or no fee. of course there is a limit to the number of these cases that anyone can take but it's worth asking. you can call your local psychologists association explain your situation and ask for the names of psychologists in your area who would be willing to help you. you can also check social service agencies as well as any major hospital center because these entities generally have access to mental-health providers who require minimal fees. <|endoftext|>

Question: i recently had an anxiety attack. the doctor prescribed medicine to use when i feel one coming. when will they go away?
Answer: since this was your first anxiety attack i'm wondering if there are some stressor in your life currently that might be causing this. often we don't realize that we are under stress until our body tells us by doing something like this. i know it's quite upsetting can be frightening but you shouldn't be embarrassed. you have done nothing for which you need to be embarrassed. it's your body responding to something either internal or external. i see that your prescriber has done the prudent thing and has given you something to use as needed. this is always a good idea but you need to do a bit of work on your own too. as i said please review your current situation and see if there is anything that might be causing you some stress or where you have neglected yourself in terms of diet sleep or social activities. all of these are vital to maintain our physical and mental health. i would also suggest that you begin engaging in some self-help techniques such as relaxation breathing mild exercise and positive self talk. <|endoftext|> 

Question: my job is causing anxiety and depression. our department may get shut down. i am on effexor and klonopin. what do i do?
Answer: considering what you are experiencing in terms of the downsizing where you work i can certainly understand your feeling anxious and not exactly happy to go to work on any given day much less monday morning. i'm wondering if the talk in the office and the general atmosphere might be contributing to how you're feeling right now. i think it probably is. when a staff is cut so dramatically it has to have consequences and one of those consequences would be anxiety. i would wonder what management is doing if anything to improve the morale of the employees in the office. right now i can imagine that you are feeling that things are a bit bleak and that your current medication hasn't been of sufficient help to you. it's my professional opinion that medication alone especially in a situation such as yours is insufficient to help you. you really need to be referred for some cognitive therapy because you need to have the opportunity not only to air your concerns but to work on things that can help you in the long run. what those things may be is not for me to say but for you and the psychologist to discover. i'm also wondering if you are doing some things which may be of help to you such as getting some regular exercise. i know that in your current situation this does not sound very appealing or even something you would want to do. let me explain. exercise can help you improve your mood and your outlook and i think that is something that needs to be worked on right now. since exercise can work in much the same way as a medication can it can make a significant difference in how you feel. it does have the ability to begin to make changes in your body's chemistry which will raise your mood lower stress and anxiety levels and even help your immune system. all of this is to your benefit. you don't have to go to a gym. go walking do some simple light weight training in the house (provided your physician agrees) and anyother type of exercise which appeals to you. i know that things may be very difficult for you now but they can improve. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i’ve overcome everyday irrational fears after ptsd but am scared to sleep. my doc recommends elavil. is it a good idea? . i work night shifts and have taken ativan.
Answer: if you would like some reassurance please check out the elavil in the pdr (physicians desk reference) which you can find in any bookstore or at your local library in the reference section. elavil is a medication that has been around for a long time and has been very helpful for many people. it does have a few side effects and you might want to acquaint yourself with them. please ask your doctor for some guidance regarding the side effects of this medication which might include some changes in your diet. have you had any therapy to help with your insomnia? i know that you had changed your work schedule in order to work nights but i am wondering if some therapy might be helpful. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i have anxiety and add. i'm taking celexa and trazadone and waiting for approval for adderall. what else can i do?

Question: i have increasing lower back pain and wonder if those special belts and posture aids ever help. i have some arthritis in my spine some scoliosis and many of my disks are partially herniated. two years ago i had a cyst and partial herniation on a lower disk and my back "went out" when i picked up a child from the floor. i had about 3 months of pretty severe pain in my left foot. i'm pretty active but it hurts most when i sweep vacuum or stand preparing food at a counter for a long time. by the way i'm 66 and female. thank you!
Answer: yes they do i had to wear one for two months because of lower back pain. ordered by my doctor who preformed back surgery on me two months later. he said if the brace works to reduce the pain then surgery will fix the problem. but if that brace changes nothing with your pain no surgery in the world will fix your problem. so give it a try what could it hurt. also while i was a mail carrier i wore one. it really took the weight of my back. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?
Answer: constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy. <|endoftext|> 

Question: are antibiotics safe during pregnancy?

Question: is tylenol the only safe over-the-counter pain-reliever during pregnancy? is tylenol pm safe?
Answer: this is a great question. tylenol pm is actually not recommended in pregnancy because of the fact that not only does it contain tylenol but it contains an antihistamine like benadryl or diphenhydramine. and that's really not recommended for use in pregnant moms. so you want to avoid that. tylenol is actually the safest pain-reliever to use in pregnant women but i want to make sure that you use it for short-term used only. and if you are going to take it make sure you check it out with your doctor first. and if you have any questions come and ask us. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is it safe to take methylprednisolone while pregnant? i've read that it can (rarely) cause birth defects.

Question: i am taking strattera and the generic of celexa. is that safe for a pregnancy?

Question: what vitamins are safe to use during pregnancy and which should be avoided?
Answer: i get asked all the time as a pharmacist about vitamin supplements and other items. come and talk to the pharmacist first. in most cases the pharmacist is going to ask you if you are seeing a doctor or ob/gyn. most likely they are going to put you on a prescription vitamin. there are specific formulations made just for pregnant women. they cover a good amount of the vitamins and also include things like iron calcium and folic acid. these are very important and not only for the mom. but for the baby as well and help in development of their spine and their brain so really important that pregnant moms understand that they need to get special vitamins made just for them. now you want to be careful and make sure that while you are taking these prenatal vitamins that you are not taking additional vitamins on top of it. you could actually take too much of certain vitamins and that may cause some problems down the road. so let your pharmacist know everything that you are taking including over-the-counter herbal and vitamins. the herbal category is an area that i would definitely avoid while you are pregnant. we just don't have any studies or data to know whether or not it's going to harm mom or baby. so better to be safe than sorry. as far as medications over-the-counters come and ask the pharmacist. if you have certain things like an upset stomach there are some products that are available and can be used in pregnant women but you really need to talk to us first. as far as prescription medications there are many different products that a pregnant mom can take and by the pharmacist and physician or healthcare provider working together. we can make sure that you are on the right ones. once again if you have any questions come and talk to us with the medication experts. <|endoftext|> 

Question: does naproxen affect blood pressure. my blood pressure is usually in the 125/72 range. but lately it has risen by 20 points for both numbers. i started taking naproxen a couple of months ago in place of aspirin. it worked better for my mild arthritis. my weight diet exercise schedule have not changed in the last 6 months. but for some reason my blood pressure has risen. i am 70 yo. and in good health. is naproxen the reason? . thanks
Answer: it looks like it can and there's even a webmd article about it! good catch. "medications that cause high blood pressure" non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) nsaids include both prescription and over-the-counter medication. they are often used to relieve pain or reduce inflammation from conditions such as arthritis. however nsaids can make your body retain fluid and decrease the function of your kidneys. this may cause your blood pressure to rise even higher putting greater stress on your heart and kidneys. nsaids can also raise your risk for heart attack or stroke especially in higher doses. common nsaids that can raise blood pressure include: ibuprofen ( advil motrin ) naproxen ( aleve naprosyn ) here's the whole article: <link> <|endoftext|> 

Question: i have or think i have rh sensitization during pregnancy when should i contact my doctor?
Answer: if you are already rh-sensitized and are pregnant your pregnancy will be closely monitored. discuss possible symptoms early in pregnancy with your health professional. repeated diagnostic testing will be necessary to monitor the fetus. call your health professional immediately if you note a decrease in your fetus's movement after 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy. if you are rh-negative call your health professional immediately if you: think you may have been pregnant and miscarried. are pregnant and have had an accident that may have injured your abdomen. regular prenatal visits are essential. you will need an rh immune globulin shot at 24 to 28 weeks and again after delivery if your baby has rh-positive blood. this is the only way you can prevent rh sensitization. watchful waiting watchful waiting is not appropriate for rh sensitization. it is important to keep all prenatal appointments so that your developing fetus can be closely monitored throughout your pregnancy. who to see a woman who may have problems with rh incompatibility or sensitization can be treated by: a family medicine doctor for mild fetal rh disease. an obstetrician for mild to moderate rh disease. a perinatologist for moderate to severe fetal rh disease ( hydrops ). if you test positive for rh sensitization your health care system or health professional may want you to be followed and treated by a perinatologist or an obstetrician who can easily call in a perinatologist. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|>

Question: what if i become pregnant while using mirena?
Answer: call your health care provider right away if you think you are pregnant. if you get pregnant while using mirena you may have an ectopic pregnancy. this means that the pregnancy is not in the uterus. unusual vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain may be a sign of ectopic pregnancy. ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding infertility and even death. there are also risks if you get pregnant while using mirena and the pregnancy is in the uterus. severe infection miscarriage premature delivery and even death can occur with pregnancies that continue with an intrauterine device (iud). because of this your health care provider may try to remove mirena even though removing it may cause a miscarriage. if mirena cannot be removed talk with your health care provider about the benefits and risks of continuing the pregnancy. if you continue your pregnancy see your health care provider regularly. call your health care provider right away if you get flu-like symptoms fever chills cramping pain bleeding vaginal discharge or fluid leaking from your vagina. these may be signs of infection. it is not known if mirena can cause long-term effects on the fetus if it stays in place during a pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Question: how should i treat any yeast infections i get while i am pregnant?
Answer: this is a question that i think is great. because one of the things that i recommend to patients is they need to see their doctor or healthcare provider first. as we may know a lot of over-the-counter yeast infection treatments are available and a person can pick them up anywhere. but when you are pregnant you want to go see your doctor to make sure that there is nothing else going on and also certain creams are preferred in pregnant women. so it maybe a cream or suppository you may walk out with a prescription or he may give you a recommendation for one of the approved products which is monistat which is available over-the-counter. but the physician or healthcare provider really needs to be involved in that. if you have any questions or are unsure just come and talk to us we will be more than happy to help you. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what increases the risk of getting rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Answer: rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. during pregnancy an rh-negative woman can become sensitized if she is carrying an rh-positive fetus. factors that increase the risk of blood mixing and sensitization during pregnancy include: 2 delivery. abdominal trauma such as from a car accident. abdominal surgery such as a cesarean section. placenta abruptio or placenta previa both of which can cause placental bleeding. external cephalic version for a breech fetus. obstetric procedures such as amniocentesis fetal blood sampling or chorionic villus sampling (cvs). miscarriage (spontaneous abortion ) ectopic pregnancy or elective abortion (medical or surgical abortion) after 8 weeks of fetal age (when fetal blood cell production begins). partial molar pregnancy involving fetal growth beyond 8 weeks. although rare rh sensitization has been known to occur after needle sharing between intravenous drug users. transfusing rh-positive blood in an rh-negative person can also trigger sensitization. but this is extremely rare because blood is always tested prior to transfusion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i am pregnant and have been told that sudafed is not safe for me to take now. any recommendations?
Answer: there actually are a few recommendations that could be used for a nasal decongestant in a pregnant woman who has a stuffy nose. saline solutions are fine to use. they come in a variety of forms including a nasal gel that they could apply inside their nose. it will help loosen up the mucous and therefore it's easier to breathe. also doing things like running a vaporizer or humidifier during the day humidifier is fine at night a vaporizer has a medicine cup in it you can put in things like vicks vaposteam inside of it. it will create this nice menthol air and that actually will help you breathe a little better at night. you could use a little bit of vicks vaporub rubbed on the chest. it's okay to use and that will also create that vapor effect. but other than that those are pretty much the choices. we just don't have enough data yet available on other decongestants that you would take by mouth to make sure that they are safe to both the mom and the baby. but if you have any questions come and ask the pharmacists or the medication experts. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is it normal to take vicodin while pregnant?
Answer: vicodin is a pain medication that should really not be used in pregnant women unless the doctor or health care provider feels that the benefits outweigh the risks. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what common medications should i avoid during my pregnancy?
Answer: there are so many different medications and we could go for hours if we went through every single one. but it really depends on what the area is. if it's a case of nasal decongestants or vitamins or things like that there are some that can't and there are some that can. but by developing that relationship with your pharmacist getting to know us on a first name basis we will be able to talk to you about anything even prescription products. we have data on prescription products about whether or not certain ones are safe to use also we can help call your doctor if you have any other concerns about a prescription. you may have been taking before you got pregnant and ask them if they want you to continue with it. but talking to your pharmacist developing that relationship that's really the key. <|endoftext|> 

Question: while pregnant can i use otc products containing benzoyl peroxide or alpha beta hydroxyls? what about retinol?
Answer: many pregnant women struggle with acne. so one of the common questions i get as a pharmacist is can i use these type of products? i really don't recommend and the reason why what a lot of people don't realize is that they can actually be absorbed through the skin and travel into the blood stream they can cause some harm to the baby. so i would just basically recommend using a basic moisturizer. i know it's tough when you have acne but it's worth it because you don't want to harm your baby. so i really caution against these type of products being used especially the night cream with a retinol. that is actually a derivative of vitamin a and there have been studies that have shown. <|endoftext|>

Question: is protonix safe for reflux in pregnancy?
Answer: there's actually been no studies done in pregnant women in the use of protonix. so at this point it is not recommended. now there are some situations where a physician may deem it completely fine for them to take but once again that doctor is going to monitor that pregnant patient pretty closely to make sure it's okay. but once again we don't have any study data available to find out if it's safe or not. so right now it is not recommended. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i have spider veins and varicose veins on my legs as a result of pregnancy and age. will lasers really zap those?
Answer: depending on how small they are lasers can be very effective in treating spider veins. i don't recommend lasers to the external surface of the skin for treating varicose veins. there are some lasers that are done within the skin by actually cutting into the vein and eliminating it that way and those are done by specialized dermatologist or vascular surgeons. but lasers on the surface can be effective for the very small spider veins. i have found though that for most spider veins sclerotherapy which is in injecting a specific ingredient that helps eliminate those veins works much better than lasers. once you have the smallest vessels left behind laser then works very well. also for varicose veins or the spider veins on the ankles i find laser as a treatment of choice in that area. <|endoftext|>

Answer: all medications can have side-effects. the only medications over-the-counter that are anti-inflammatory and used to treat arthritis would ibuprofen (motrin advil) and aleve. aspirin can also be used but it would be best for you to check with your medical provider first. someone that knows you and your medical history the type/severity of your arthritis and of course recommending the proper dosage for you. treating arthritis can be complicated and there are no cookie-cutter type treatments that work for everyone and all can have side-effects. <|endoftext|>

Question: can arthritis inflammation make my blood sugar higher?
Answer: i am a non medical person but diabetic for the past 15 years. you need to be talking to your doctor preferably a specialist. however my experience says everything impacts your blood sugar. certainly the pain of arthritis and the stress of aches and pains can increase you blood sugar. it also can interfere with sleep which also can causes higher blood sugars. if you take anything prescription or over the counter for the arthritis it can leave you slightly dehydrated which can increase your blood sugar. any stress or illness can increase your blood sugar. if you haven't been diagnosed as diabetic get a check up. if you have been diagnosed get back to your doctor. good luck. . <|endoftext|>

Question: how long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?
Answer: most healthy women under the age of 30 shouldn't worry about infertility unless they've been trying to get pregnant for at least a year. at this point women should talk to their doctors about a fertility evaluation. men should also talk to their doctors if this much time has passed. in some cases women should talk to their doctors sooner. women in their 30s who've been trying to get pregnant for six months should speak to their doctors as soon as possible. a woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30. so getting a complete and timely fertility evaluation is especially important. some health issues also increase the risk of fertility problems. so women with the following issues should speak to their doctors as soon as possible: irregular periods or no menstrual periods very painful periods endometriosis pelvic inflammatory disease more than one miscarriage <|endoftext|>

Question: how to tell if you have arthritis. my hands and fingers hurt all the time. i can no longer fully close my right fist. i can not snap my fingers or open jars or bottles. when working with small items my fingers and hands cramp up on me.
Answer: arthritis comes in different forms. but some hallmark signs of most arthritic conditions include pain joint swelling and difficultly in articulating the movement of joints. some of the symptoms listed in your question could be signs of an arthritic condition. they could also be signs of some other medical disorders. arthritis can affect individuals of any age but its diagnosis increases as we age. as most doctors can attest to many of their patients complain of back pain after reaching 40 years of age. an x-ray of those painful 40 something old backs may show as the only notable impression the fact that arthritic/degenerative changes were observed. i suggest that you make an appointment with the family doctor who may assess your discomfort and any range of motion limitations. that same person may get the diagnostic ball rolling by requesting x-ray images ordering blood work and other lab studies. the general practicing physician may also start you on some regime of ant-inflammatory and pain medication as well as referring you to other medical specialists such as orthopedists or rheumatologists. i hope that you have found this answer helpful and that your pain cramping and fist closure issues resolve themselves soon. . <|endoftext|>

(most health professionals treat all rh-negative pregnant women as though the father might be rh-positive. ) if you are already sensitized to the rh factor your pregnancy will need to be closely monitored to prevent fetal harm. for more information on fetal and newborn treatment see the treatment overview section of this topic. if you are unsensitized rh-negative treatment focuses on preventing rh sensitization during pregnancy and childbirth. rh immune globulin (such as rhogam) is a highly effective treatment for preventing sensitization. to prevent sensitization from occurring late in the pregnancy or during delivery you must have a shot of rh immune globulin around week 28 of your pregnancy. this treatment prevents your immune system from making antibodies against your fetus's rh-positive red blood cells. rh immune globulin injection is also necessary if you have had any vaginal bleeding or an obstetric procedure such as amniocentesis or external cephalic version. if your newborn is rh-positive you are given rh immune globulin again within 72 hours of delivery. by preventing rh sensitization from delivery you are protecting your next rh-positive fetus. if your newborn is rh-negative sensitization cannot happen and no treatment is necessary. rh immune globulin is also necessary after a miscarriage partial molar pregnancy ectopic pregnancy or abortion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|>

Question: how is rh sensitization during pregnancy treated?
Answer: if you are sensitized to the rh factor if your blood is rh-negative and you have been sensitized to rh-positive blood you now have antibodies to rh-positive blood. the antibodies kill rh-positive red blood cells. if you become pregnant with an rh-positive baby ( fetus ) the antibodies can destroy your fetus's red blood cells. this can cause anemia. if you are already rh-sensitized and are pregnant your treatment will focus on preventing or minimizing fetal harm and on avoiding early (preterm) delivery. treatment options depend on how well or poorly the fetus is doing. if testing shows that your fetus is rh-positive but is only mildly affected by your rh factor antibodies you will be closely monitored until your pregnancy reaches term. your fetus will be delivered early only if his or her condition worsens. if testing shows that your fetus is moderately affected by your rh antibodies your fetus's condition will be closely monitored until his or her lungs are mature enough for a preterm delivery. a cesarean section may be used to deliver the baby quickly or to avoid the difficulty of inducing labor before term. a moderately affected newborn sometimes requires a blood transfusion immediately after birth. if testing shows that your fetus is severely affected by your rh factor antibodies a blood transfusion may be given before birth ( intrauterine fetal blood transfusion ). this can be done through the fetus's abdomen or directly into the fetus's umbilical cord. a preterm delivery is likely to be needed. multiple blood transfusions are sometimes needed to keep a fetus healthy until the fetal lungs mature enough to function after birth. often a cesarean section is done to deliver the baby quickly. a blood transfusion is sometimes needed immediately after birth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Answer: if you are rh-negative your red blood cells do not have a marker called rh factor on them. rh-positive blood does have this marker. if your blood mixes with rh-positive blood your immune system will react to the rh factor by making antibodies to destroy it. this immune system response is called rh sensitization. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|>

Question: my mother is 43 years old. whenever she walks for two minutes or so her pulse rises. what is triggerig that? . ok so she has mixed connective tissue disease arthritis diabetes iron and vitamin d deficiency she removed her kidney stones from about 12-13 years. she has cysts in her breasts and ovaries but they are not cancerous. she usually sits ad does not walk or work. however when she walks for about 2 minutes her pulse rises to 140+ and so does her bp. any ideas to what might cause her this and/or if there is a treatment?
Answer: it's perfectly normal for a person's pulse and blood pressure to rise when they walk or run. this happens because the heart must pump more blood -- faster -- to serve oxygen to the body's tissues. in fact the whole purpose of "aerobic" activity like walking is to increase the heart rate. and if a person is "out of shape" (that is they are moving from a very sedentary lifestyle to a more active one) the rise in pulse rate and blood pressure is likely to occur more quickly than it would in someone whose body is used to physical activity. that said it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any exercise program. i suspect your mother's primary care provider will clear her for an easy exercise program such as walking but it's better to check with the doctor first. i hate to dissuade anyone from walking because it's normally a harmless activity and a pulse of 140 isn't necessarily "bad" (in fact a pulse of 140 is lower than my own target heart rate ) but i cannot give medical advice. and so my suggestion is for your mother to check with her doctor to make sure walking is ok for exercise purposes. in general walking is among the safest and most effective ways to lose weight and get the heart (cardiovascular) system into shape. walking even for short periods of time or for short distances (to start) can be a good way to build up to more exertion such as jogging. wishing you well! <|endoftext|>

Question: what causes rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Answer: rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. about 90% of women who become sensitized do so during childbirth when their blood mixes with the rh-positive blood of their fetus. 1 once exposed a mother's immune system produces antibodies against rh-positive red blood cells. for more information about events and procedures that can put you at high risk for rh sensitization see the what increases your risk section of this topic. the minimum amount of blood mixing necessary to cause sensitization is not known. but many women become sensitized during pregnancy or childbirth after being exposed to as little as of rh-positive fetal blood. 1 fortunately rh sensitization can almost always be prevented with the rh immune globulin injection. when an rh-negative person's immune system is first exposed to rh-positive blood it takes several weeks to develop immunoglobulin m or igm antibodies. igm antibodies are too large to cross the placenta. so the rh-positive fetus that first triggers maternal sensitization is usually not harmed. a previously rh-sensitized immune system rapidly reacts to rh-positive blood as during a second pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus. usually within hours of rh-positive blood exposure smaller immunoglobulin g or igg antibodies are formed. igg antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. this causes rh disease which is dangerous for the fetus. some rh-negative people never become sensitized even after exposure to large amounts of rh-positive blood. the reason for this is not known. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|>

Answer: it's difficult to understand why some women gain more than the recommended amounts during one pregnancy when they seem to be monitoring every bite then put on the same amount of weight with the next baby when they pay much less attention to how much they eat. unless you monitor every morsel you eat and every move you make it's impossible to chalk up the pregnancy weight gain to anything but pregnancy metabolism. women who have struggled with eating disorders may be fearful of gaining weight even during pregnancy. it's important to discuss your feelings about food with a qualified health care professional. intentionally restricting calories to keep weight gain low can harm your baby's growth and development. pregnancy is no time to diet even if you started off overweight. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how much extra food should i eat while pregnant?
Answer: pregnancy hormones can play havoc with appetite causing some women to feel famished. others are daunted by nausea vomiting and fatigue that diminish their desire for food. in both cases the best strategy is trying as much as possible to adhere to a balanced diet that accounts for physical activity and stage of pregnancy like the ones offered at mypyramid. gov. a nutritious pregnancy eating plan with adequate calories -- about 340 more calories each day than your prepregnancy needs starting in the second trimester and about 450 more than your prepregnancy diet during the last three months of pregnancy -- should be enough to prevent constant hunger. women who are particularly physically active during pregnancy may need more calories however. choosing foods that fill you up as part of a balanced pregnancy diet improves eating satisfaction. for example whole grains vegetables and legumes are filled with fiber to keep you fuller for longer without any extra calories. drink plenty of fluids; it works with fiber to keep you full and to prevent constipation a common pregnancy complaint. <|endoftext|> 

Question: does a person get a high from capsule medical marijuana? does it dull pain or just make the pain tolerable? . could this help a 95 year old who is in severe pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis? does it really have any long term effects on memory?
Answer: i would be reluctant to use medical marijuana on an elderly person who may have problems with memory and mental processing as it is. however a pain managment specialist may have different ideas. this 95 year old should really see a pain specialist so that his/her pain can be pharmaceutically managed taking into account all of there medical history. personally i have never prescribed it for these reasons. <|endoftext|> 

Question: does a person get a high from capsule medical marijuana? does it dull pain or just make the pain tolerable? . could this help a 95 year old who is in severe pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis? does it really have any long term effects on memory?
Answer: as a former pain pill addict and current medicinal user of cannabis i must respectfully disagree with the doctor. new research is showing that marijuana does not effect the memory in the ways previously thought. however i will admit the effects of marijuana on an elderly patient especially one that has never used it before may be a bit overwhelming. are you in a state where it is legal medicinally because it would be best to do under the care of a doctor considering the age factor. marijuana is a much safer form of pain control than traditional narcotics. it is also being shown to have benefits on numerous other conditions. you can always do the research if you have any doubts or concerns. also to answer your original question marijuana does not come in pill form there is a synthetic pill called marinol but it is not exactly the same as cannabis and is usually only prescribed for cancer patients. there is a variety of ways to reap the benefits of marijuana. i would suggest cannabis oil. a little bit placed under the tongue can go along way. there is also edibles such as cookies cakes and brownies but those tend to have a more psychoactive effect and may be a bit too overwhelming. smoking it is an option but with the patients age i would advice against this. if you are in a state where it is legalized for medicinal use talk with a doctor about your options. if unfortunately your in a state like me where its not you can always find all the information you could ever want or need online. just be careful and make sure you check the sources of the information your reading. also be careful of the law as i can personally attest to even if your just trying to use a safe alternate to treat your pain they will still treat you like a criminal. <|endoftext|>

Question: what happens if i gain too much or too little during pregnancy?
Answer: in the short term gaining the suggested amount of weight reduces the risk of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and promotes a baby that isn't too big or too small at delivery. in the long run research suggests that the greater the weight gain during pregnancy the higher the risk of having an overweight child and one with higher blood pressure. children who are born too small which can result from inadequate weight gain during pregnancy are more prone to certain chronic conditions including heart disease and diabetes during adulthood. what if you miss the mark for recommended weight gain? if you're off by just a few pounds either way it probably won't make much of a difference. the iom (institute of medicine) guidelines provide a range in each bmi category suggesting that good outcomes are achieved with all different weight gains. listen to the advice of your doctor or nurse-midwife about weight gain but if you have doubts ask what's right for you. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how much weight is it ok to gain during pregnancy?
Answer: most doctors base their recommendation of weight gain on the weight of the mom before pregnancy. women with a normal bmi (body mass index) should gain anywhere between 25 and 35 pounds and up to 45 for twins. overweight women may be able to safely gain between 15 and 25 pounds but should not use pregnancy as a time to diet or lose weight. check with your doctor to determine if it is safe for you to gain less or more than the recommended range. <|endoftext|>

Question: when should i start gaining weight during pregnancy?
Answer: when it comes to pregnancy pounds timing matters. chances are weight gain during the first three months will be minimal -- and should be according to the iom (institute of medicine) guidelines. you don't need any extra calories during the first trimester; although the baby's growth is rapid he is so small that his development doesn't warrant additional energy. however you may add some pounds to your frame during the first three months because you're hungrier or because of fluid retention. some women even lose weight because they don't feel well enough to eat their usual diet. once the second trimester starts and the baby's growth begins in earnest gaining weight on a steady basis is a must. plan on putting on about a pound each week with a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and below and about a half pound a week if you had a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and above. <|endoftext|>

Question: what happens to the breasts in pregnancy?
Answer: during pregnancy the breasts grow. this growth is much more uniform than that at adolescence. the breasts of women with small breasts tend to grow about as much during pregnancy as those of women with large breasts. the amount of milk-producing tissue is essentially the same. this is the reason that when milk production begins small-breasted women produce as much milk as do large-breasted women. <|endoftext|>

Question: what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy?
Answer: about 20% of women have some bleeding during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. possible causes of first trimester bleeding include: implantation bleeding. you may experience some normal spotting within the first six to 12 days after you conceive as the fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus. some women don't realize they are pregnant because they mistake this bleeding for a light period. usually the bleeding is very light and lasts from a few hours to a few days. miscarriage. because miscarriage is most common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it tends to be one of the biggest concerns with first trimester bleeding. about half of women who bleed in pregnancy eventually miscarry but that doesn't necessarily mean that if you're bleeding you've lost the baby especially if you don't have any other symptoms. other symptoms of miscarriage are strong cramps in the lower abdomen and tissue passing through the vagina. ectopic pregnancy. in an ectopic pregnancy the fertilized embryo implants outside of the uterus usually in the fallopian tube. if the embryo keeps growing it can cause the fallopian tube to burst which can be life-threatening to the mother. although ectopic pregnancy is potentially dangerous it only occurs in about 2% of pregnancies. other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are strong cramps or pain in the lower abdomen and lightheadedness. molar pregnancy (also called gestational trophoblastic disease). this is a very rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside the uterus instead of a baby. in rare cases the tissue is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. other symptoms of molar pregnancy are severe nausea and vomiting and rapid enlargement of the uterus. additional causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include: cervical changes. during pregnancy extra blood flows to the cervix. intercourse or a pap test which cause contact with the cervix can trigger bleeding. this type of bleeding isn't cause for concern. infection. any infection of the cervix vagina or a sexually transmitted infection (such as chlamydia gonorrhea or herpes) can cause bleeding in the first trimester. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy?
Answer: implantation bleeding can last longer than 12 days. it maybe considered something else after so long but that is what my dr. called it. i am not writing this because i think i know more than what wmd gave as an answer. however as a first time pregnant woman who has experienced light bleeding and cramping intermittently from week 3rd through my current 7th week i believe there is not enough information available about 1st trimester bleeding. i read so many articles like this that my head was swimming. i knew i wasn't having a miscarriage but what i was reading (all from credible sources btw) left me feeling like i was either doomed to miscarry or i would be bed ridden. when i went in for an ultra sound the nurse pointed out a little dark area between the amniotic sac and my uterine wall. she said that is where the blood was coming from. at 7w1d i was still experiencing implantation bleeding- it was still attaching in an area. she said it is common and everything was fine! i saw my little button wiggle and we heard a heart beat! baby measures perfectly. not every story is going to end quite as uncomplicated but i want women to have hope. there are a lot of answers- every pregnancy is different. talk to your dr. and never ever assume the worst. there is hope! <|endoftext|> 

Question: what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy?

Question: is tendinits and arthritist the same
Answer: no but they can have similar symptoms in the joints. tendonitis involves tendons (muscles and their connective tissue) and arthritis involves the bony aspect of joint. a person can have both and to a certain extent both may be treated similarly depending on the location and severity. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is tendinits and arthritist the same
Answer: tendinitis can be a symptom associated with arthritis. they are learning more and more about arthritis every day. osteoarthritis (oa) is a wearing down of the cartilage that protects the bone ends. arthritis causes the cartilage to breakdown and then you have bone rubbing on bone and the bone then tries to protect itself by growing more bone this is called "osteophytes" and this is quite painful because this re grown bone is not nice and smooth but is lumpy and bumpy. cartilage is soft tissue not bone. some new research is suggesting that there may symptoms in the tendons and muscles which attach at or near the bone ends prior to xray evidence of oa. pain tendinitis bursitis can be a signal that something is wrong with the joint. i have severe generalized multi-site osteoarthritis (this oa is inherited most often bilateral: hands knees hips and so on) and i can tell you that this is so true. i knew that my knees were bad before there was xray evidence just due to the pain type and location. my elbows both have been so painful and i know that it is working on the joints while there is still no xray evidence it will be there soon. although they are saying that the elbows are not included in this form of oa i can tell you that they are by my own observations. my elbows can be so painful that i wake in the mornings just about screaming in pain when i try to move one or both. see a doctor before it becomes chronic pain. good luck to you. <|endoftext|> 

Question: my wife has just been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and her sister has ms are the two diseases related? . my wife has just been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and her sister has ms are the two diseases related?
Answer: this is a really good question. there is a lot that we don’t really know about rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and multiple sclerosis (ms). both ms and ra are considered to be autoimmune diseases. this means that for some reason the body’s own immune system attacks parts of itself. in ra the immune system begins to attack the joints. in ms it attacks the brain and spinal cord. why this happens in some people is not entirely clear. certain autoimmune diseases and the tendency to get autoimmune diseases does seem to run in families. it is thought that different things can trigger ms and ra. these triggers may be hormonal genetic or environmental. exposure to certain viruses is thought to be a trigger. epstein-barr virus (ebv) has suspected links to both ra and ms. there are also other connections. some studies suggest that ms patients may be more likely to get ra and other autoimmune diseases. and a treatment for ra called anti-tnf therapy can cause a condition very similar to ms. i hope this helps. as you can see we all still have a lot to learn about ms ra and all the other autoimmune diseases. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.
Answer: hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically "osteoarthritis" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the "wear and tear" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define "arthritis" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps! <|endoftext|>

Answer: i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck <|endoftext|>

Answer: your doctor may advise you not to have intercourse if you have any of the following types of high-risk pregnancy: risk of miscarriage or history of past miscarriages. risk of preterm labor (contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy) which puts you at risk of delivering a premature baby. vaginal bleeding discharge or cramping without a known cause. ruptured membranes and leakage of fluid from the amniotic sac. incompetent cervix (a damaged cervix that has opened too early in pregnancy). placenta previa (the placenta is positioned abnormally low in the uterus near the cervix). twins triplets or other "multiples.

Question: is sex during pregnancy safe?
Answer: sex is a natural normal part of pregnancy -- if you're having a normal pregnancy. the movement and penetration of intercourse in itself won't harm the baby. your baby is protected by your abdomen and the muscular walls of the uterus. your baby is also cushioned by the fluid in the amniotic sac. as a general safety precaution some doctors advise avoiding sex in the last few weeks of pregnancy believing that hormones in semen called prostaglandins can stimulate contractions. one exception? women who are overdue and want to induce labor. some doctors believe that prostaglandins in semen actually induce labor in a full-term or past-due pregnancy since the gel used to "ripen" the cervix and induce labor also contains prostaglandins. if you have a high-risk pregnancy -- for instance with a complication such as preterm labor or risk of miscarriage -- your doctor may advise you to avoid sex during pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Question: what causes bleeding in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy?
Answer: abnormal bleeding in late pregnancy may be more serious because it can signal a problem with the mother or baby. call your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any bleeding in your second or third trimester. possible causes of bleeding in late pregnancy include: placenta previa. this condition occurs when the placenta sits low in the uterus and partially or completely covers the opening of the birth canal. although placenta previa is very rare occurring in only one in 200 pregnancies it is an emergency requiring immediate medical attention. bleeding from placenta previa can often occur without any pain. placental abruption. in about 1% of pregnancies the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus before or during labor and blood pools between the placenta and uterus. placental abruption can be very dangerous to both the mother and baby. other symptoms of placental abruption are abdominal pain clots from the vagina tender uterus and back pain. uterine rupture. in rare cases a scar from a previous c-section can tear open during pregnancy. uterine rupture can be life-threatening and requires an emergency c-section. other symptoms of uterine rupture are pain and tenderness in the abdomen. vasa previa. in this very rare condition the developing baby's blood vessels in the umbilical cord or placenta cross the opening to the birth canal. vasa previa can be very dangerous to the baby because the blood vessels can tear open causing the baby to bleed severely and lose oxygen. other symptoms of vasa previa include abnormal fetal heart rate and excessive bleeding. premature labor. vaginal bleeding late in pregnancy may just be a sign that your body is getting ready to deliver. a few days or weeks before labor begins the mucus plug that covers the opening of the uterus will pass out of the vagina and it will usually have small amounts of blood in it (this is known as "bloody show"). if bleeding and symptoms of labor begin before the 37th week of pregnancy contact your doctor right away because you might be in preterm labor. other symptoms of preterm labor include contractions vaginal discharge abdominal pressure and ache in the lower back. additional causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are: injury to the cervix or vagina polyps cancer. <|endoftext|>

Question: can a third metacrapal fracture be fixed 5 years later? . i broke the neck of my third metacarpal (middle finger) about 6 years ago. the results are that my middle finger knuckle is less pronounced on my right hand because the bone healed at a slightly downwards angle. the hand has recently started to bother me a bit (arthritis and fixation on the cosmetics of the hand). is it possible to have surgery/ re-break the bone and straighten it out so that further complications do not arise later on in life. i am 24 now and broke this when i was 18.
Answer: yes i am sure you can find an orthopedic (hand) surgeon willing to do take a crack at it (no pun intended) but you could be asking for more trouble than it is worth. in order to get a better cosmetic result it will require a re-break and perhaps a pinning of the metacarpal in order to straighten out the bent digit. the orthopedist will tell you the pros and cons and hopefully your insurance company will be agreeable to paying for it. <|endoftext|>

Question: i have arthritis. would it be better for me to move from ct to va. not willing to move west lots of family in the neast
Answer: i'm sorry to hear you have arthritis. it's certainly a very common ailment. i guess i'm going to assume you're referring to osteoarthritis which is the wear-and-tear disease that makes the joints hurt. this type of arthritis frequently comes on as we get older. just to be clear there's another type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis that is an autoimmune disease. but based on your question i'm thinking you're referring to plain old arthritis that hurts worse when the weather gets colder. if that's the case moving from connecticut to virginia probably won't help. while it's true coldness can make the pain of osteoarthritis feel worse virginia probably isn't sufficiently warmer than connecticut in the winter to make much of a difference. now if you were talking about becoming a snowbird and flying down to florida to spend your winters then i'd probably say that's a fine idea. it's also important to take into consideration where your support system resides. when your arthritis symptoms become so severe you need help with daily or periodic tasks you need to be living where your family and friends are close enough to help you. if that's in new england then that's probably not a bad place for you to stay. i hope this helps! <|endoftext|> 

Question: i have arthritis. would it be better for me to move from ct to va. not willing to move west lots of family in the neast
Answer: i've lived in va all my life and have osteo lupus and fibro. while it is warmer here in the winter than ct we do get some winters that are fairly cold - it does vary considerably and it varies a lot depending on where you live in va. another thing to weigh in is the heat and humidity - most of va especially the central and eastern half - is quite humid and is very hot in the summer. it's not unusual for it to start going into the 90's in late april and stay in that range until well into october. this summer we had long stretches of days in the high 90's - low 100's with humidity in the 80-90% range - and the combination of heat and humidity is particularly brutal especially if your arthritis causes compression of your c-spine nerves and you have a problem with sweating and body temp regulation because of it and/or if you are prone to migraines and sinus issues. the hot humid weather makes me far more miserable than the coldest days ever do and the older i get the less i seem able to tolerate it. so that's something to bear in mind when you consider moving here. (and please don't get me wrong i love my home state and am proud to be a virginian! ) <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is the likelihood of arthritis in joints near the base of fractured metatarsals #2 and #3? . if metatarsals #2 and #3 are fractured at the base near the joints of the midfoot what is the likelihood of arthritis particularly if metatarsal #2 is comminuted at the joint? is this a true lisfranc fracture? (aircast and no surgery)
Answer: the short answer to your question is that the development of osteoarthritis does seem more prevalent in joints that have been injured in the past. so you may development osteoarthritis of your foot in the future. that said the midfoot is not a common place to develop osteoarthritis. (the big toe is a more common target for arthritis. ) in terms of whether or not you suffered a lisfranc injury it does sound like it from your description. a midfoot injury is deemed a "lisfranc fracture" (or dislocation or injury) when any of the metatarsal bones separates from the tarsus which is the cluster of bones from the heel to the midfoot. this usually happens due to a crushing injury like dropping a jar of pickles on your foot. athletes in certain sports are more prone to lisfranc injuries. these include football and snowboarding. lisfranc injuries occur in varying degrees of severity. slight dislocations often are treated just as you described with some type of splinting (an air cast). severe dislocations require surgery. hope this helps and that you get better soon! <|endoftext|>

Question: does a prolactinoma affect pregnancy?
Answer: if a woman has a small prolactinoma there is usually no reason that she cannot conceive and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. the pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. but damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in less than 1% of pregnant women with prolactinomas. in women with large tumors the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater. if a woman has already completed a successful pregnancy the likelihood of future successful pregnancies is extremely high. a woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive with her physician so she can be carefully evaluated prior to pregnancy. this evaluation typically includes a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. as soon as the patient becomes pregnant her doctor will usually advise that she discontinue bromocriptine (parlodel) or cabergoline (dostinex). patients should consult their hormone specialists (endocrinologists) promptly if symptoms develop – particularly headaches visual changes nausea vomiting excessive thirst or urination or extreme lethargy. bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if symptoms occur as a result of growth of the tumor during pregnancy. <|endoftext|>

Answer: when deciding whether or not to use a medicine in pregnancy you and your doctor need to talk about the medicine's benefits and risks. benefits: what are the good things the medicine can do for me and my growing baby (fetus)? risks: what are the ways the medicine might harm me or my growing baby (fetus)? there may be times during pregnancy when using medicine is a choice. some of the medicine choices you and your doctor make while you are pregnant may differ from the choices you make when you are not pregnant. for example if you get a cold you may decide to "live with" your stuffy nose instead of using the "stuffy nose" medicine you use when you are not pregnant. other times using medicine is not a choice -- it is needed. some women need to use medicines while they are pregnant. sometimes women need medicine for a few days or a couple of weeks to treat a problem like a bladder infection or strep throat. other women need to use medicine every day to control long-term health problems like asthma diabetes depression or seizures. also some women have a pregnancy problem that needs medicine treatment. these problems include severe nausea and vomiting earlier pregnancy losses or preterm labor. <|endoftext|> 

Question: are herbal remedies or natural products safe for me when i am pregnant?
Answer: except for some vitamins little is known about using dietary supplements while pregnant. some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. but most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. these products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy. in the u. s. there are different laws for medicines and for dietary supplements. the part of the fda that controls dietary supplements is the same part that controls foods sold in the u. s. only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before october 15 1994 submit safety information for review by the fda. however unlike medicines herbal remedies and "natural products" are not approved by the fda for safety or for what they say they will do. most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. before a company can sell a medicine the company must complete many studies and send the results to the fda. many scientists and doctors at the fda check the study results. the fda allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are the warning signs of depression both during and after pregnancy?
Answer: any of these symptoms during and after pregnancy that last longer than two weeks are signs of depression: feeling restless or irritable feeling sad hopeless and overwhelmed crying a lot having no energy or motivation eating too little or too much sleeping too little or too much trouble focusing remembering or making decisions feeling worthless and guilty loss of interest or pleasure in activities withdrawal from friends and family having headaches chest pains heart palpitations (the heart beating fast and feeling like it is skipping beats) or hyperventilation (fast and shallow breathing). after pregnancy signs of depression may also include being afraid of hurting the baby or oneself and not having any interest in the baby. <|endoftext|> 

Question: in the future will there be better ways to know if medicines are safe to use during pregnancy?
Answer: at this time drugs are rarely tested for safety in pregnant women for fear of harming the unborn baby. until this changes pregnancy exposure registries help doctors and researchers learn how medicines affect pregnant mothers and their growing baby. a pregnancy exposure registry is a study that enrolls pregnant women who are using a certain medicine. the women sign up for the study while pregnant and are followed for a certain length of time after the baby is born. researchers compare babies with mothers who used the medicine while pregnant to babies with mothers who did not use the medicine. this type of study compares large groups of pregnant mothers and babies to look for medicine effects. a woman and her doctor can use registry results to make more informed choices about using medicine while pregnant. if you are pregnant and are using a medicine or were using one when you got pregnant check to see if there is a pregnancy exposure registry for that medicine. the food and drug administration has a list of pregnancy exposure registries (<link> that pregnant women can join. <|endoftext|> 

Question: where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy?
Answer: doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages textbooks and research journals. they also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines. the food and drug administration (fda) is the part of the u. s. government that controls the medicines that can and can't be sold in the u. s. the fda lets a company sell a medicine in the u. s. if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem. companies that make medicines usually have to show fda doctors and scientists whether birth defects or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals. most of the time drugs are not studied in pregnant women. the fda works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels. but in most cases there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing babies. many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals. but a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way. here is an example: a medicine is given to pregnant rats. if the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies it may or may not cause problems in human babies. if there are no problems in the rat babies it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies. the fda asks for studies in two different kinds of animals. this improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies. there is a lot that fda doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy. in a perfect world every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine's effects on pregnant women and their growing babies. unfortunately this is not the case. <|endoftext|>

Question: how common is depression during and after pregnancy?
Answer: depression that occurs during pregnancy or within a year after delivery is called perinatal depression. the exact number of women with depression during this time is unknown. but researchers believe that depression is one of the most common complications during and after pregnancy. often the depression is not recognized or treated because some normal pregnancy changes cause similar symptoms and are happening at the same time. tiredness problems sleeping stronger emotional reactions and changes in body weight may occur during pregnancy and after pregnancy. but these symptoms may also be signs of depression. <|endoftext|> 

Question: are vitamins safe for me while i am pregnant?
Answer: regular multivitamins and prenatal vitamins are safe to take during pregnancy and can be helpful. women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily multivitamin or prenatal vitamin that contains at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. it is best to start taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. folic acid reduces the chance of a baby having a neural tube defect like spina bifida in which the spine or brain does not form the right way. iron can help prevent a low blood count (anemia). it's important to take the vitamin dose prescribed by your doctor. too many vitamins can harm your baby. for example very high levels of vitamin a have been linked with severe birth defects. <|endoftext|>

Question: are supplements helpful for arthritis?
Answer: glucosamine and chondroitin are nutritional supplements that are being studied for their effectiveness in treating arthritis. jason theodosakis md assistant clinical professor at the university of arizona college of medicine says that "first-line therapies" for the treatment of arthritis should always be improving biomechanics injury prevention weight control and low-impact exercise. "but there is also enough scientific evidence -- 42 human clinical trials to date -- to recommend the use of glucosamine and chondroitin " says theodosakis also the author of the arthritis cure. "it seems that researchers are having a difficult time confirming the beneficial effects of [glucosamine and chondroitin] " says robert hoffman do chief of rheumatology at the university of miami miller school of medicine. "the good news is the supplements seem to be safe [at the standard dosage] but it's not clear that they're beneficial. i don't feel compelled to highly recommend them. but if patients don't mind taking another pill -- and paying for a pill that may or may not help them -- it seems quite reasonable. and really there isn't anything else that helps slow the progression of osteoarthritis.

Question: what is 0-negative arthritis?
Answer: this is probably what is referred to as "sero-negative arthritis. " this is a form of arthritis that is characterized by inflammation (hot swollen tender painful stiff) of joints but is not associated with the classic blood (serum) test for rheumatoid arthritis called rheumatoid factor. we refer to these patients as being rheumatoid factor negative in their serum or seronegative. the term is nonspecific and it is possible for a patient's condition to evolve at a later time into a more classical identifiable disease. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is arthritis?
Answer: the word "arthritis" means "joint inflammation. " inflammation is one of the body's natural reactions to disease or injury and includes swelling pain and stiffness. inflammation that lasts for a very long time or recurs as in arthritis can lead to tissue damage. a joint is where two or more bones come together such as the hip or knee. the bones of a joint are covered with a smooth spongy material called cartilage which cushions the bones and allows the joint to move without pain. the joint is lined by a thin film of tissue called the synovium. the synovium's lining produces a slippery fluid called synovial fluid that nourishes the joint and helps reduce friction. strong bands of tissue called ligaments connect the bones and help keep the joint stable. muscles and tendons also support the joints and enable you to move. with arthritis an area in or around a joint becomes inflamed causing pain stiffness and sometimes difficulty moving. some types of arthritis also affect other parts of the body such as the skin and internal organs. there are over 100 types of arthritis including osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and gout. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is rheumatoid arthritis and how is it different from "old age" arthritis?
Answer: rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to turn on itself attacking tissue that normally helps protect and preserve joint function. during an ra "attack" -- known as a flare -- the immune system sends out a barrage of white blood cells to the affected joint which in turn causes inflammation in the area. it is this inflammation that is responsible for the symptoms of ra including joint swelling and pain. osteoarthritis also known as "old age arthritis" or "wear and tear arthritis" is a natural degeneration of the cartilage between joints that occurs with aging. the degeneration can be worsened by overuse or injury but its impact is limited to the affected joints. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is rheumatoid arthritis and how is it different from "old age" arthritis?

Question: is fibromyalgia pain similar to arthritis pain?
Answer: fibromyalgia can cause symptoms similar to arthritis bursitis and tendinitis. consequently some experts group fibromyalgia with arthritis and related disorders. the pain associated with these other conditions is typically localized to a single area while the pain and stiffness of fibromyalgia are very widespread and consists of deep muscle pain morning stiffness and painful tender points making it difficult to exercise or be physically active. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is crystalline arthritis (gout and pseudogout) of the knee and how is it treated?
Answer: these severely painful forms of arthritis are caused by sharp crystals that form in the knee and other joints. these crystals can form as a result of defects in the absorption or metabolism of various natural substances such as uric acid (which produces gout) and calcium pyrophosphate (pseudogout). treatment is aimed at controlling inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications and at aiding the metabolism of the various chemicals that may lead to crystal formation. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can i have intercourse during pregnancy?
Answer: intercourse during pregnancy is safe for most women. special situations in which women might be advised to avoid intercourse include prior preterm labor multiple miscarriages infection bleeding amniotic fluid leak and a condition called placenta previa or low placenta. (a placenta previa is when the placenta is implanted near the outlet of the uterus so that at the time of delivery the placenta precedes the baby. placenta previa can cause painless bleeding in the last trimester of pregnancy and may be a reason for a c-section). all women are advised to avoid sexual intercourse that could put them at risk of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how does alcohol affect pregnancy?
Answer: alcohol has been implicated in infertility early miscarriage as well as in birth defects. the amount of alcohol consumption necessary to cause these problems is not known and varies among women. some women can drink excessively and have normal infants. others consume considerably less alcohol but still give birth to babies with cognitive disabilities and/or other birth defects. it is generally believed that the greater the amount of alcohol consumed during pregnancy the greater the risk of pregnancy-related problems and birth defects. it is recommended that pregnant women avoid all consumption of alcohol. fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a group of conditions reflecting the possible effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. the fasds include fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) alcohol-related birth defects (arbd) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disabilities (arnd). fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) is the extreme end of the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how does alcohol affect pregnancy?

Question: how can diet and nutrition affect early pregnancy?
Answer: the developing fetus receives its nutrition from the mother's blood. therefore high-fat diets and some vegetarian diets are discouraged during pregnancy because they may not provide all the nutrition needed for the developing fetus. bulimia anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders in the mother need to be addressed and treated. weight reduction diets are avoided. excess intake of sugar alcohol megavitamins and caffeine should also be avoided. because a "safe" amount of caffeine has never been confirmed to date it is best to avoid caffeine entirely. women who feel strongly that they need some coffee are advised to drink no more than one cup per day. there is no proof that one to two cups of coffee daily cause pregnancy complications. listeria is a type of bacteria found in contaminated food that can cause miscarriage and other problems to a fetus. because of the danger of getting a listeria infection pregnant women should avoid unpasteurized milk soft cheeses cold cuts and undercooked or raw animal foods. in addition fruits and vegetables should be washed completely prior to consumption. phenylketonuria is an inherited disease that affects the utilization of a certain protein component in foods. this disorder can be detected by a blood test. mothers with phenylketonuria may give birth to developmentally disabled children unless their diets are strictly controlled to exclude phenylalanine. megavitamins contain double or even triple the recommended daily allowances of vitamins and minerals. high doses of vitamin a have been implicated in producing birth defects. the better idea is to avoid megavitamins and instead follow the recommendation that has proven benefit: take a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid. folic acid intake in the mother prior to and during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the risk of birth defects involving the brain and spinal cord. the u. s. public health service recommends folic acid for all women of childbearing capacity. studies have shown that if folic acid is begun at least four weeks prior to conception the risk of birth defects of the spinal cord and skull can be reduced by more than 70%. in women with or even without a history of having infants with birth defects of the spinal cord or skull folic acid should be taken one month before conception and continued through the 12th week of pregnancy. in fact continuing prenatal vitamins through pregnancy and even through nursing is probably wise. these prenatal vitamins are available over the counter. if a particular brand makes you feel nauseated simply switch to another brand or try taking the vitamin at night. because of the risks of mercury poisoning and nervous system damage in the fetus from contaminated fish pregnant women are advised to eliminate consumption of certain types of fish that are known to be high in mercury including shark swordfish tilefish and king mackerel. tuna steaks made from large tuna may also have high mercury levels. canned tuna is made from smaller fish that typically have lower levels of mercury than larger fish. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are examples of commonly used medications that are dangerous in pregnancy?
Answer: many women do not know that over-the-counter medications can be dangerous. in fact many prescription and over-the-counter medications harm the fetus very early in pregnancy at a time that the mother does not even know she is pregnant. even aspirin use by the mother can cause defects in the fetus. for this reason as soon as pregnancy is being contemplated women should avoid all over-the-counter and prescription medications until they are reviewed with the doctor. acne medications such as isotretinoin (accutane) can cause birth defects and should be discontinued before conception. since many medications and substances can affect fetal growth and development pregnancy planning is important so that potentially harmful substances can be stopped before conceiving. unplanned pregnancy during oral contraceptive use is not felt to pose a significant danger to the fetus although deliberate use of oral contraceptives during pregnancy is not advisable. women who become pregnant during oral contraceptive use have the same risk of birth defects in their newborns as the general population of women in the range of 2%-3%. <|endoftext|>

Question: is it safe to drink during pregnancy?
Answer: no alcohol can harm the baby of a mother who drinks during pregnancy. although the highest risk is to babies whose mothers drink heavily it is not clear yet whether there is any completely safe level of alcohol during pregnancy. for this reason the u. s. surgeon general released advisories in 1981 and again in 2005 urging women who are pregnant or may become pregnant to abstain from alcohol. the damage caused by prenatal alcohol includes a range of physical behavioral and learning problems in babies. babies most severely affected have what is called fetal alcohol syndrome (fas). these babies may have abnormal facial features and severe learning disabilities. babies can also be born with mild disabilities without the facial changes typical of fas. <|endoftext|>

Question: what causes depression in women specifically related to pregnancy and childbirth?
Answer: there may be a number of reasons why a woman gets depressed. hormone changes or a stressful life event such as a death in the family can cause chemical changes in the brain that lead to depression. depression is also an illness that runs in some families. other times it's not clear what causes depression. during pregnancy during pregnancy these factors may increase a woman's chance of depression: history of depression or substance abuse family history of mental illness little support from family and friends anxiety about the fetus problems with previous pregnancy or birth marital or financial problems young age (of mother) after pregnancy depression after pregnancy is called postpartum depression or peripartum depression. after pregnancy hormonal changes in a woman's body may trigger symptoms of depression. during pregnancy the amount of two female hormones estrogen and progesterone in a woman's body increases greatly. in the first 24 hours after childbirth the amount of these hormones rapidly drops back down to their normal non-pregnant levels. researchers think the fast change in hormone levels may lead to depression just as smaller changes in hormones can affect a woman's moods before she gets her menstrual period. occasionally levels of thyroid hormones may also drop after giving birth. the thyroid is a small gland in the neck that helps to regulate your metabolism (how your body uses and stores energy from food). low thyroid levels can cause symptoms of depression including depressed mood decreased interest in things irritability fatigue difficulty concentrating sleep problems and weight gain. a simple blood test can tell if this condition is causing a woman's depression. if so thyroid medicine can be prescribed by a doctor. other factors that may contribute to postpartum depression include: feeling tired after delivery broken sleep patterns and not enough rest often keeps a new mother from regaining her full strength for weeks. feeling overwhelmed with a new or another baby to take care of and doubting your ability to be a good mother. feeling stress from changes in work and home routines. sometimes women think they have to be "super mom" or perfect which is not realistic and can add stress. having feelings of loss -- loss of identity of who you are or were before having the baby loss of control loss of your pre-pregnancy figure and feeling less attractive. having less free time and less control over time. having to stay home indoors for longer periods of time and having less time to spend with your partner and loved ones. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what should i do if i show signs of depression during or after pregnancy?
Answer: some women don't tell anyone about their symptoms because they feel embarrassed ashamed or guilty about feeling depressed when they are supposed to be happy. they worry that they will be viewed as unfit parents. perinatal depression can happen to any woman. it does not mean you are a bad or "not-together" mom. you and your baby don't have to suffer. there is help. there are different types of individual and group "talk therapies" that can help a woman with perinatal depression feel better and do better as a mom and as a person. limited research suggests that many women with perinatal depression improve when treated with antidepressant medicine. your doctor can help you learn more about these options and decide which approach is best for you and your baby. speak to your doctor or midwife if you are having symptoms of depression while you are pregnant or after you deliver your baby. your doctor or midwife can give you a questionnaire to test for depression and can also refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in treating depression. here are some other helpful tips: try to get as much rest as you can. try to nap when the baby naps. stop putting pressure on yourself to do everything. do as much as you can and leave the rest. ask for help with household chores and nighttime feedings. ask your husband or partner to bring the baby to you so you can breastfeed. if you can have a friend family member or professional support person help you in the home for part of the day. talk to your husband partner family and friends about how you are feeling. do not spend a lot of time alone. get dressed and leave the house. run an errand or take a short walk. spend time alone with your husband or partner. talk with other mothers so you can learn from their experiences. join a support group for women with depression. call a local hotline or look in your telephone book for information and services. don't make any major life changes during pregnancy. major changes can cause unneeded stress. sometimes big changes cannot be avoided. when that happens try to arrange support and help in your new situation ahead of time. <|endoftext|> 

Question: how common is arthritis in children?
Answer: arthritis affects approximately one child in every 1 000 in a given year. fortunately most of these cases are mild. however approximately one child in every 10 000 will have more severe arthritis that doesn't just go away. many children have what is called an acute inflammatory arthritis following a viral or bacterial infection. this arthritis is often quite severe for a brief period but usually disappears within a few weeks or months. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (jra) is the most common type of arthritis that persists for months or years at a time. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is also now called juvenile arthritis or juvenile arthritis of unknown cause (juvenile idiopathic arthritis). <|endoftext|> 

Question: how is arthritis diagnosed?
Answer: arthritis is inflammation in a joint. diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain stiffness and/or warmth redness or swelling and physical examination. the examination can demonstrate swelling and often limited range of motion of the joint. x-ray examination can support the diagnosis and often disclose the type of arthritis and it's severity. early diagnosis is important for early treatment. many types of arthritis can progress without treatment. this can lead to permanent destruction of cartilage bone and ligaments which can result in deformity and loss of function that is not reversible. moreover some forms of arthritis are associated with disease elsewhere in the body. to avoid injury to other body tissues early diagnosis can be crucial. <|endoftext|>

Question: i've had arthritis and heberden's nodes in my hands for several years. cysts are forming on the nodes. what can i do?
Answer: heberden's nodes are bony prominences that occur at the smallest joint at the end of the fingers. they develop as a result of inflammation that occurs in the bone under adjacent cartilage that has wear from degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis). they can become inflamed at times and be painful. sometimes a tiny fluid-filled cyst called a ganglion forms adjacent to the involved joint. to reduce inflammation sometimes anti-inflammatory medications can be of help. if a cyst has formed at the joint it can require an evaluation by a hand surgeon to consider surgical removal. you should discuss the best options for you with your doctor. <|endoftext|> 

Question: isn't arthritis an old person's disease not a disease in children?
Answer: most lay people and many doctors fail to appreciate that arthritis in children exists. for the children affected and their families education about the condition is essential. many children suffer for months or years before the diagnosis of arthritis is thought of and proper treatment begun. but the problem doesn't end there. children with arthritis frequently experience difficulty because their teachers and schoolmates don't understand that children can develop arthritis. they have no idea what to expect from the child with arthritis or about the nature of the illness. as a result when the child is finally diagnosed with arthritis the family may be told just to put him or her in a wheelchair because "nothing can be done. " this is entirely wrong. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what is the outlook for children with arthritis?
Answer: with proper therapy the children with arthritis will usually improve over time. indeed the vast majority of children with arthritis grow up to lead normal lives without significant difficulty. even for severe cases with proper medications proper physical and occupational therapy and proper surgery if necessary virtually no one with arthritis should need a wheelchair. everyone's doctor knows stories of children who looked awful but did very well or looked like it was "nothing serious " who became very sick. but these are the rare exceptions. there are many recent significant improvements in treating children with arthritis. for over 95% of the children with arthritis today we don't need new drugs or miraculous inventions. we just need proper application of the resources we already have. there are three important things for every child or adolescent with arthritis. first is proper recognition and diagnosis of the disease. second is proper treatment by an experienced physician with multidisciplinary support including physical and occupational therapists and orthopedic surgeons. third is proper education of the patient and family. people with arthritis are no different than everyone else in the world. they all need to grow up have jobs get married and have families. some will have some difficulty with mechanical problems. many will have small things they can't do if you watch them carefully. few will go on to be professional athletes or military officers but even fewer will be "totally disabled" by their disease. there are far more children who are disabled because they are told they couldn't do things than children who are really disabled by their disease. we should never accept a child with arthritis being told to use a wheelchair. in almost every case it is hoped that we will be able to correct the problem and get them walking again. this is why educating the public and physicians is so important. it must be appreciated that children can develop arthritis and must be properly diagnosed and treated. each child should be able to reach his or her full potential. children with arthritis should be treated just like everyone else. they need the same discipline the same allowance the same grades and the same respect as all the other children. arthritis might affect the body but it must never be allowed to affect the mind. <|endoftext|>

Answer: along with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis there are several other forms of arthritis that can affect children and adolescents. interestingly these most often affect older children (greater than 8 years of age) and teenagers while typical juvenile rheumatoid arthritis most often affects young children. one type of childhood arthritis is the kind that affects teenagers who have rheumatoid factor-positive arthritis with involvement of the small joints in the hands and feet. rheumatoid factor is a blood-test finding which is present in most adults with rheumatoid arthritis but absent in most children with jra. it is present in this group because they usually are teenagers who have adult-type rheumatoid arthritis starting early. because it is starting early this is a worrisome group and these children need to be treated aggressively. often they will have lifelong arthritis. another form of arthritis that is common in this "older" group is spondyloarthropathy. this is a family of diseases in which the arthritis is the same but the associated problems are very different. the typical findings of a spondyloarthropathy are early involvement of the hips and other large joints. in addition these forms of arthritis tend to be asymmetric -- one side of the body is more severely affected than the other. the key finding is that these children not only have inflamed joints but they also have inflammation at the points where tissues attach to bone such as tendons and ligaments. often they have ankle or heel pain due to inflammation of the tendons inserting in the foot. in some mild cases the tendon inflammation occurs without obvious swollen joints. it is important to recognize the spondyloarthropathies as different from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis because the optimal treatment monitoring and outcome is likely to be different. in addition one must look carefully for evidence of the other diseases that can be associated with spondyloarthropathies. these include inflammatory bowel disease psoriasis reactive arthritis and behcet's syndrome. the most worrisome children with spondyloarthropathies are the hla b27-positive boys. they are at risk for developing ankylosing spondylitis. however most children with spondyloarthropathies seem to do reasonably well. in general for children who are hla b27 negative and do not have an associated condition the arthritis is more likely than jra to come and go repeatedly over a period of years but is less likely to be very severe or destructive. unfortunately we have only recognized children with spondyloarthropathies as being "different" since the middle 1970s so no good long-term follow-up data is available yet. sometimes children with a form of chronic skin inflammation called psoriasis can develop arthritis. this form of arthritis is referred to as psoriatic arthritis. occasionally there is a family history of psoriasis that can help clue the doctor into this diagnosis. <|endoftext|> 

Question: are there any particular foods which should be included or excluded from the diet of an individual who has arthritis?
Answer: first there are many forms of arthritis each of which differ in the do's and don'ts of diet. so the answer is that it depends to some degree on the form of arthritis. persons with gouty arthritis should tend to avoid red meats shellfish alcohol and dehydration. at the same time dairy products such as low-fat milk and yogurt as well as adequate hydration are encouraged in persons with gout. persons with inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis may benefit by taking the omega-3 fatty acids that are in the oils of fish particularly salmon. those with osteoarthritis might benefit from the food supplement glucosamine. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are symptoms and signs of arthritis of the hand and wrist?
Answer: the most common symptoms of arthritis of the hands include pain stiffness and swelling over the joints. the pain is usually worsened when the joint is moved. moreover motion of the joint is frequently limited due to pain and joint contractures. symptoms can lead to difficulty with daily living activities including tying shoes buttoning buttons opening jars or turning a key in a lock. physical signs of arthritis of the hand include changes in the appearance of the joints. the joints most commonly affected by degenerative arthritis are those at the ends of the fingers. swelling and bumps or nodes can occur at the small joints at the area of the base of the nail. these bumps are called heberden nodes and can become extremely painful. the joint at the base of the thumb can also become swollen with bone spurs and cause pain and deformity. the joint destruction also leads to severe pain when pinching the fingers together and gripping forcefully. joint motion limitation can also decrease the ability to grip. wrist arthritis can cause pain with motion of the wrist or grasping and lifting. wrist range of motion is frequently limited by the arthritis. patients typically experience relief when the wrist is stabilized by a splint. rheumatoid arthritis frequently causes swelling pain and stiffness in the wrists as well as the small joints in the middle and at the base of the fingers. this disease frequently causes hand deformities. tissue lumps called rheumatoid nodules can form over the joints of the hand and wrist. the joints of the fingers and thumb can become deformed and contracted by the destruction of the supporting ligaments so that grasping and pinching movements are not possible. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is the pneumococcal vaccine safe for pregnant women?
Answer: the safety of the pneumococcal vaccine for pregnant women has not yet been studied. there is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before becoming pregnant if possible. <|endoftext|> 

Question: when is joint replacement surgery the best surgical option for arthritis of the hand?

Question: should i be concerned if i have hashimoto's thyroiditis and want to become pregnant?
Answer: hashimoto's thyroiditis is not a reason to avoid pregnancy. however some women with hashimoto's thyroiditis do have trouble conceiving. in some patients supplementation with selenium is used to try to decrease antibody levels. (the theory is that lower antibody levels may lead to better success in conception. ) both before and during pregnancy the levels of thyroid hormones need to be checked to make certain they are in the optimal range for pregnancy. this is usually within the range for nonpregnant women but at the higher end of the range. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what if i am already pregnant and use plan b?

Question: what if i'm pregnant when i travel?
Answer: pregnant women should consult with their obstetrician before travel. if available a consultation with a travel-medicine specialist is also recommended. live vaccines are usually avoided in pregnancy. some medications must also be avoided. this may put pregnant women at higher risk for getting sick in a foreign country. pregnant women should also be aware that the quality of obstetrical care in foreign countries varies considerably. it is best to have the name of a reputable clinic or hospital on hand. women in the third trimester should consider delaying travel until after delivery. check with your health insurance provider in advance to determine what is covered in the destination country. diarrhea some types of hepatitis and malaria can be especially severe in pregnant women. follow food water and insect precautions. avoid areas with malaria if at all possible and take medications as directed. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can i do pilates if i'm pregnant?
Answer: you should check with your doctor if you are pregnant and want to try pilates. there are currently no studies to prove the safety or efficacy of pilates during pregnancy. this is not to say that it is unsafe but you should check with your doctor first. there is evidence that aerobic exercise during pregnancy at a level great enough to produce a training effect does not adversely affect birth weight or other maternal and infant outcomes and that it may be associated with fewer pregnancy-associated discomforts but there is limited research on weight lifting and pregnancy. the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists in their position statement on pregnancy and exercise recommend limiting repetitive isometric or heavy resistance weight lifting and any exercises that result in a large rise in blood pressure. pilates can be both isometric and high intensity so the instructor should account for that when teaching you pilates if you are pregnant. again check with your doctor if you are pregnant and want to try pilates. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?
Answer: if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated. <|endoftext|> 

Question: does trichomoniasis cause problems during pregnancy?
Answer: yes. trichomoniasis can cause babies to be born early or at a low birth weight (less than 5 pounds). the cdc recommends that women with trichomoniasis who have symptoms should be treated but women without symptoms do not need to be treated. during the first three months of pregnancy many experts feel that women shouldn't take metronidazole (flagyl) because it may hurt the baby. however most doctors feel that metronidazole can be given safely after the end of the first trimester. <|endoftext|> 

Question: can a woman get pregnant using the withdrawal method of birth control?

Question: what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?
Answer: having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy-related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately more than 40% of pregnancies in the u. s. are unplanned and many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. public education is important to improve pregnancy planning. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience a weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving. women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well. <|endoftext|> 

Question: what are pregnancy symptoms?
Answer: there are both symptoms and signs of pregnancy. these symptoms and signs depend upon the time in pregnancy. in the first trimester of pregnancy the first sign of pregnancy is most often a missed menstrual period. if a sexually active woman's periods are generally regular missing a period for a week or more is presumptive evidence of pregnancy. early symptoms of pregnancy also include feelings of breast swelling and tenderness and nausea sometimes with vomiting. "morning sickness" does not always occur in the morning. many women become fatigued early in pregnancy and some may feel abdominal enlargement (bloating). early in pregnancy the woman may feel she has to urinate frequently especially at nighttime and she may leak urine when coughing sneezing or laughing. this is also normal later in pregnancy and is not a problem. other changes characteristic of pregnancy include the deepening color of the areola (area surrounding the nipple) increased body temperature the mask of pregnancy (darkening of skin on the forehead bridge of the nose or cheekbones) and a dark line going down from the middle of the central abdomen area to the pubic area. eventually enlargement of the abdomen is a normal feature of the growing fetus. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i am pregnant and wonder if stress have caused the blood vessels in my eyes to burst?
Answer: the conjunctiva the thin watery membrane that coasts the eye contains many small blood vessels. occasionally these blood vessels can burst and led to hemorrhage (bleeding) that appears as a red patch on the white of the eye. in the majority of cases this type of bleeding (called subconjunctival hemorrhage) occurs without a known cause. subconjunctival hemorrhage can also result from certain medical conditions including trauma high blood pressure eye infections and bleeding disorders. the straining associated with vomiting coughing or sneezing can also sometimes lead to subconjunctival hemorrhage. stress is not a recognized cause of subconjunctival hemorrhage. a conjunctival hemorrhage may be cosmetically annoying but they do not endanger the vision. <|endoftext|> 

Question: my girlfriend and i have been trying to get pregnant for 10 months; she is stressed. does stress affect our chances?
Answer: psychological stress is known to affect many physiological processes including hormone levels and the function of the immune system both of which can play a role in fertility. while there is no proof that stress alone is a cause of infertility some studies have shown that stress can adversely affect outcome in people undergoing fertility treatments and may be an aggravating factor for infertility. however trying to conceive for 10 months without success is not yet considered indicative of a fertility problem. in the absence of known conditions that may affect the reproductive system infertility is defined as the absence of conception after a period of 1 year. many couples who eventually conceive without fertility treatment do so after waiting even longer than a year. since your girlfriend is already feeling stressed it would make sense to develop a stress management plan and to learn skills to help control her stress levels. exercise proper nutrition relaxation techniques a regular sleep cycle and psychological counseling if needed can all significantly reduce symptoms due to emotional stress and lead to improvements in physical and mental well-being. if your girlfriend is concerned that an emotional or physical problem may be interfering with your ability to conceive she should discuss this with her doctor who can help determine whether you have a fertility problem. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i am going to be trying to get pregnant soon and want to know what are blood type and rh tests?
Answer: a blood type test categorizes your blood according to the major human blood group (abo) system. a person's abo type depends upon the presence or absence of two genes — the a and b genes. these genes determine part of the configuration of the red blood cell surface. possible abo blood groups include o a b or ab. the rh antigen is another compound that may or may not be present on the surface of red blood cells. the rh test determines whether this configuration is present ("rh-positive") or absent ("rh-negative") on an individual's blood cells. rh testing is performed because the difference in rh blood group types between an rh-negative mother and her rh-positive baby can lead to hemolytic disease a severe condition in which there is breakdown of the red blood cells in the newborn. if an rh-negative mother carries an rh-positive fetus she may develop antibodies against the rh component of the baby's red blood cells. these antibodies could cause hemolytic disease of an rh-positive baby in subsequent pregnancies. prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn is carried out by giving rh-negative mothers rho (d) immune globulin (brand name: rhogam) after delivery of an rh-positive baby. this prevents the mother's immune system from reacting to the rh-positive blood of any subsequent fetus. <|endoftext|> 

Question: i got a negative result on a home pregnancy test. might i still be pregnant?
Answer: yes. every woman ovulates at different times in her menstrual cycle. plus embryos implant in the uterus at different times. so most home pregnancy tests suggest women take the test again in a few days or a week. sometimes women get false negative results (when the test says you are not pregnant and you are) when they test too early in the pregnancy. other times problems with the pregnancy can affect the amount of hcg in the urine. if your hpt is negative test yourself again in a few days or one week. if you keep getting a negative result but think you are pregnant talk with your doctor right away. <|endoftext|> 

Question: is there any contraindication in administering a helicobacter pylor urea breath test to a pregnant women?
Answer: there is no need to administer a urea breath test to a pregnant woman. the presence or absence of h. pylori can be determined accurately from a sample of stool. there are two types of urea breath tests for diagnosing h. pylori. one uses a very small dose of urea that is labelled with a radioactive isotope of carbon and the other uses urea that is labelled with a non-radioactive isotope of carbon. the non-radioactive isotope has no adverse effects. the radioactive isotope is not recommended for use in pregnant women. <|endoftext|>

Answer: the answer is that liver damage from acetaminophen occurs when the glutathione pathway is overwhelmed by too much of acetaminophen's metabolite napqi. then this toxic compound accumulates in the liver and causes the damage. furthermore alcohol and certain medications such as phenobarbital phenytoin (dilantin) or carbamazepine (tegretol) (anti-seizure medications) or isoniazid (inh nydrazid laniazid) an anti-tuberculosis drug can significantly increase the damage. they do this by making the cytochrome p-450 system in the liver more active. this increased p-450 activity results in an increased formation of napqi from the acetaminophen. additionally chronic alcohol use as well as the fasting state or poor nutrition can each deplete the liver's glutathione. so alcohol both increases the toxic compound and decreases the detoxifying material. accordingly the bottom line in an acetaminophen overdose is that when the amount of napqi is too much for the available glutathione to detoxify liver damage occurs. <|endoftext|>
